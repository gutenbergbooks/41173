<p class="ctrlarge">THE NON-SLAVEHOLDERS OF THE SLAVE STATES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">We ask your attention to the injuries inflicted upon you and your
children, by an institution which lives by your sufferance, and will
die at your mandate. Slavery is maintained by <i>you</i> whom it impoverishes
and degrades, not by those upon whom it confers
wealth and influence. These assertions will be received by you
and others with surprise and incredulity. Before you condemn
them, ponder the following considerations and statistics.</p>

<p class="indent">We all know that the sugar and cotton cultivation of the South
is conducted, not like the agriculture of the North, on small
farms and with few hands, but on vast plantations and with large
gangs of negroes, technically called &quot;the force.&quot; In the breeding
States, men, women and children form the great staple for
exportation; and like other stock, require capital on the part of
those who follow the business of rearing them. It is also a
matter of notoriety, that the price of slaves has been and still is
such as to confine their possession almost exclusively to the rich.
We might as well talk of poor men owning herds of cattle and
studs of horses, as gangs of negroes. When an infant will bring
one hundred, and a man from four hundred to a thousand dollars
in the market, slaves are not commodities to be found in the
cabins of the poor. You are moreover aware that the great
capitalists of the South have their wealth chiefly invested in
plantations and slaves, and not as with us in commerce and
manufactures.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been repeatedly stated that Mr. Carroll, of Baltimore,
the former president of the Colonization Society, was the owner
of 1,000 slaves. The newspapers, in announcing the death of
Mr. Pollock, of North Carolina, remarked that he had left 1,500
slaves. In the account of Mr. Madison&#39;s funeral, it was mentioned
that he was followed to the grave by 100 of his slaves,
and it is probable that the women and children were not included.
The following article, from the <i>Gospel Messenger</i> for August,
1842, gives us some idea of the feudal vassalage prevailing on
the estates of some of your lordly planters. &quot;<span class="smcap">A noble deed.</span>&mdash;Dr.
Mercer, of Adams county, Mississippi, has lately erected, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
his own expense, and for the advantage of his <i>vast</i> plantation, and
the people on his lands, a neat church and parsonage house, at
the cost of over $30,000. He pays the salary of the minister,
$1,200 a year, besides his meat and bread. On Bishop Otey&#39;s
late visit to that congregation, he and Mr. Deacon, the incumbent,
baptized in one day <i>one hundred and eight</i> children and <i>ten</i>
adults, all belonging to the plantation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the North a farmer hires as many <i>men</i> as his work requires;
at the South the laborers cannot be separated from the <i>women</i>
and <i>children</i>. These are <i>property</i>, and must be owned by somebody.
Now when we take this last circumstance into consideration,
and at the same time recollect that the very value of the
slaves debars the poor from owning them&mdash;and connect these
two facts with the character of the cultivation in which slave
labor is employed; we must be ready to admit that those who do
employ this species of labor, cannot on an average hold less than
<i>ten slaves</i>, including able-bodied men, their wives and children. It
appears by the census, that of the slave population, the two
sexes are almost exactly equal in number; and that there are
two children under ten years of age, for every male slave over
that age. Hence, if a planter employs only three men, we may
take it for granted that his slave family consists of at least 12
souls, viz.: 3 men, 3 women, and 6 children. We of course
estimate the number of children too low, since there will be
some over ten years of age. It thus appears that the average
number of slaves we assign to each slaveholder is probably far
below the truth; but we purposely avoid even the approach to
exaggeration. Now the number of slaves in the United States
by the last census, was 2,487,113; of course according to
our estimate of ten slaves to one master, there can be only
248,711 slaveholders.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%" summary="nonslaveholders">

<td class="tdr">767,596</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">We are not forgetful that our enumeration must embrace some
who are the <i>sons</i> of slaveholders, and who are therefore interested
in upholding the system,&mdash;but we are fully convinced that our
estimate of the number of slaveholders is far beyond the truth,
and that we may therefore safely throw out of account the very
moderate number of slaveholders&#39; sons above 20 years of age,
and not themselves possessing slaves.</p>

<p class="indent">Here then, fellow-citizens, you see your strength. You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
a majority of 518,885 over the slaveholders; and now we repeat,
that with a numerical majority of more than half a million,
slavery lives or dies at <i>your</i> behest.</p>

<p class="indent">We know that this result is so startling and unexpected, that
you will scarcely credit the testimony of figures themselves. It
is so commonly taken for granted, that every white man at the
South is a slaveholder, that many will doubtingly inquire, where
are these non-slaveholding citizens to be found? We answer,
everywhere. Is poverty of rare occurrence in any country? Has
it ever happened that the mass of any people were rich enough
to keep, for their own convenience, such expensive laborers&mdash;as
southern slaves? Slavery moreover is monopolizing in its tendency,
and leads to the accumulation of property in few hands.
It is also to be observed, that the high price of slaves, and the
character of the cultivation in which they are employed, both
conspire to concentrate this class of laborers on particular spots,
and in the hands of large proprietors. Now the census shows
that in some districts the slaves are collected in vast numbers,
while in others they are necessarily few. Thus, for instance, in
Georgetown district, S. Carolina, there are about 7.5 slaves to
every white man, woman and child, in the district. Now if
from the white population in this district we exclude all but the
slaveholders themselves, the average number of slaves held by
them would probably exceed one hundred. On the other hand,
we find all through the slave States, many districts where the
slaves bear a very small proportion to the whites, and where, of
course, the non-slaveholders must form a vast and overwhelming
majority. A few instances must suffice.</p>

Mr. Nicholas, in a speech in the Kentucky Legislature in 1837, objected
to calling a convention to alter the Constitution, because in such
a convention he believed the abolition of slavery would be agitated; and
he reminded the house, that in the State &quot;the slaveholders do not stand
in the ratio of more than one to six or seven.&quot; Of course slavery is
maintained in Kentucky, through the consent of the non-slaveholders.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">There is not a State or Territory in the Union in which you,
fellow-citizens, have not an overwhelming majority over the slaveholders;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and the majority is probably the greatest in those in
which the slaves are the most numerous, because in such they
are chiefly concentrated on large plantations.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been the policy of the slaveholders to keep entirely out
of sight their own numerical inferiority, and to speak and act as
if <i>their</i> interests were those of the whole community. They are
the nobility of the south, and they find it expedient to forget that
there are any commoners. Hence with them slavery is the <span class="smcap">institution</span>
of the <span class="smcap">south</span>, while it is in fact the institution of only a
portion of the people of the south. It is their craft to magnify
and extol the importance and advantages of <i>their</i> institution; and
hence we are told by Gov. McDuffie, that slavery &quot;is the CORNER
STONE of our republican institutions.&quot; To defend this
corner stone from the assaults of truth and reason, he audaciously
proposed to the legislature, that abolitionists should be punished
&quot;with death without benefit of clergy.&quot; This gentleman, like
most demagogues, while professing great zeal for the <span class="smcap">People</span>,
whose interests were for the most part adverse to slavery, was in
fact looking to his own aggrandizement. He was, at the very
time he uttered these absurd and murderous sentiments, a great
planter, and his large &quot;force&quot; was said to have raised in 1836,
no less than 122,500&nbsp;lbs. of cotton.

<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In the same spirit, and
with the same design, the Report of a Committee of the South
Carolina Legislature, made in 1842, speaks of slavery &quot;as an ancient
domestic institution, <i>cherished in the hearts of the people at
the south</i>, the eradication of which would demolish our whole system
of policy, domestic, social, and political.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The slaveholders form a powerful landed aristocracy, banded
together for the preservation of their own privileges, and ever
endeavoring, for obvious reasons, to identify their private interests
with the public welfare. Thus have the landed proprietors of
England declaimed loudly on the blessings of dear bread, because
the corn laws keep up rents and the price of land. The wealth
and influence of your aristocracy, together with your own poverty,
have led you to look up to them with a reverence bordering
on that which is paid to a feudal nobility by their hereditary dependents.
Hence it is, that, unconscious of your own power, you
have permitted them to assume, as of right, the whole legislation
and government of your respective States. We now propose to
call your attention to the practical results of that control over
<i>your</i> interests, which, by your sufferance, they have so long exercised.
We ask you to join us in the inquiry how far you have
been benefitted by the care of your guardians, when compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
with the people of the North, who have been left to govern themselves.

<h2>I. INCREASE OF POPULATION.</h2>

<p class="indent">The ratio of increase of population, especially in this country,
is one of the surest tests of public prosperity. Let us then
again listen to the impartial testimony of the late census. From
this we learn that the increase of population in the free States
from 1830 to 1840, was at the rate of 38 per cent., while the
increase of the <i>free</i> population in the slave States was only 23 per
cent. Why this difference of 15 in the two ratios? No other
cause can be assigned than slavery, which drives from your borders
many of the virtuous and enterprising, and at the same time
deters emigrants from other States and from foreign countries
from settling among you.</p>

<p class="indent">The influence of slavery on population is strikingly illustrated
by a comparison between Kentucky and Ohio. These two States
are of nearly equal areas, Kentucky however having about 3000
square miles more than the other.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They are separated only by
a river, and are both remarkable for the fertility of their soil; but
one has, from the beginning, been cursed with slavery, and the
other blessed with freedom. Now mark their respective careers.</p>

<p class="indent">The value of land, other things being equal, is in proportion to
the density of the population. Now the population of Ohio is
38.8 to a square mile, while the free population of Kentucky is
but 14.2 to a square mile&mdash;and probably the price of land in the
two States is much in the same proportion. You are told, much
of the wealth is invested in negroes&mdash;yet it obviously is a wealth
that impoverishes; and no stronger evidence of the truth of this
assertion is needed, than the comparative price of land in the free
and slave States. The two principal cities of Kentucky and Ohio
are Louisville and Cincinnati; the former with a population of
21,210, the latter with a population of 46,338. Why this difference?
The question is answered by the <i>Louisville Journal</i>. The
editor, speaking of the two rival cities, remarks, &quot;The most potent
cause of the more rapid advancement of Cincinnati than
Louisville is the <span class="smcap">absence of slavery</span>. The same influences
which made Ohio the young giant of the West, and is advancing
Indiana to a grade higher than Kentucky, have operated in the
<i>Queen</i> City. They have no <i>dead weight to carry</i>, and consequently
have the advantage in the race.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In 1840, Mr. C. M. Clay, a member of the Kentucky Legislature,
published a pamphlet against the repeal of the law prohibiting
the importation of slaves from the other States. We extract
the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The world is teeming with improved machinery, the combined
development of science and art. <i>To us it is all lost; we are comparatively
living in centuries that are gone; we cannot make it, we
cannot use it when made.</i> Ohio is many years younger, and possessed
of fewer advantages than our State. Cincinnati has manufactories

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Mr. Thomas F. Marshall, of Kentucky, in a pamphlet published
the same year, and on the same subject, draws the following
comparison between Virginia and New York:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;In 1790, Virginia, with 70,000 square miles of territory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
contained a population of 749,308. New York, upon a surface
of 45,658 square miles, contained a population of 344,120.
This statement exhibits in favor of Virginia a difference of 24,242
square miles of territory, and 408,188 in population, which is the
<i>double</i> of New York, and 68,600 more. In 1830, after a race of
forty years, Virginia is found to contain 1,211,405 souls, and New
York 1,918,608, which exhibits a difference in favor of New
York of 607,203. The increase on the part of Virginia will be
perceived to be 463,187, starting from a basis more than double
as large as that of New York. The increase of New York, upon
a basis of 340,120, has been 1,578,391 human beings. Virginia
has increased in a ratio of 61 per cent., and New York in that of
566 per cent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The total amount of property in Virginia under the assessment
of 1838, was $211,930,508. The aggregate value of real and
personal property in New York, in 1839, was $654,000,000, exhibiting
an excess in New York over Virginia of capital of $442,069,492.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Statesmen may differ about policy, or the means to be employed
in the promotion of the public good, but surely they
ought to be agreed as to what prosperity means. I think there
can be no dispute that New York is a greater, richer, a more
prosperous and powerful State than Virginia. What has occasioned
the difference?... There is but one explanation
of the facts I have shown. The clog that has stayed the
march of her people, the incubus that has weighed down her
enterprise, strangled her commerce, kept sealed her exhaustless
fountains of mineral wealth, and paralyzed her arts, manufactures
and improvement, is NEGRO SLAVERY.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">These statements were made before the results of the last
census were known. By the census of 1840, it appears that in
the ten preceding years,</p>

<p class="indent">We surely need not detain you with farther details on this head,
to convince you what an enormous sacrifice of happiness and
prosperity you are offering on the altar of slavery. But of the
character and extent of this sacrifice you have as yet had only
a partial glimpse. Let us proceed to examine</p>

<h2>II. THE STATE OF EDUCATION IN THE SLAVE<br />
STATES.</h2>

<p class="indent">The maxim that &quot;Knowledge is power,&quot; has ever more or less
influenced the conduct of aristocracies. Education elevates the
inferior classes of society, teaches them their rights, and points
out the means of enforcing them. Of course, it tends to diminish
the influence of wealth, birth, and rank. In 1671, Sir William
Berkley, then Governor of Virginia, in his answer to the inquiries
of the Committee of the Colonies, remarked, &quot;I thank God that
there are no free schools nor printing presses, and I hope we
shall not have them these hundred years.&quot; The spirit of Sir
William seems still to preside in the councils of his own Virginia,
and to actuate those of the other slave States.</p>

<p class="indent">The power of the slaveholders, as we have already showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
you, depends on the acquiescence of the major part of the white
inhabitants in their domination. It cannot be, therefore, the interest
or the inclination of the sagacious and reflecting among
them, to promote the intellectual improvement of the inferior
class.</p>

<p class="indent">In the free States, on the contrary, where there is no caste answering
to your slaveholders&mdash;where the <i>People</i> literally partake
in the government, mighty efforts are made for general education;
and in most instances, elementary instruction is, through the public
liberality, brought within the reach of the children of the poor.
You have lamentable experience, that such is not the case where
slaveholders bear rule.</p>

<p class="indent">But you will receive with distrust whatever <i>we</i> may say as to
the comparative ignorance of the free and slave States. Examine
then for yourselves the returns of the last census on this point.
This document gives us the number of white persons over twenty
years of age in each State, who cannot read <i>and</i> write. It appears
that these persons are to the <i>whole</i> white population in the several
States as follows, viz.:</p>

<p class="indent">It will be observed by looking at this table, that Indiana and
Illinois are the <i>only</i> free States, which in point of education are
surpassed by <i>any</i> of the slave States: for this disgraceful circumstance
three causes may be assigned, viz., their recent settlement,
the influx of foreigners, and emigration from the slave
States. The returns from New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, are greatly affected by the vast number of
foreigners congregated in their cities, and employed in their
manufactories and on their public works. In Ohio, also, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
a large foreign population: and it is well known that comparatively
few emigrants from Europe seek a residence in the slave States,
where there is little or no employment to invite them. But what
a commentary on slavery and slaveholders is afforded by the gross
ignorance prevailing in the old States of South Carolina, Virginia,
and North Carolina! But let us proceed. The census gives a
return of &quot;scholars at public charge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But we have some <i>official</i> confessions, which give a still more
deplorable account of Southern ignorance. In 1837, Governor
Clarke, in his message to the Kentucky Legislature, remarked,
&quot;By the computation of those most familiar with the subject, <span class="smcap">one
third of the adult population of the state are unable
to write their names</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Governor Campbell reported to the Virginia Legislature, that
from the returns of 98 clerks, it appeared that of <i>4614 applications
for marriage licenses in 1837, no less than 1047 were made
by men unable to write</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">These details will enable you to estimate the impudence of the
following plea in behalf of slavery:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;It is by the existence of slavery, exempting so large a portion
of our citizens from the necessity of bodily labor, that we have
leisure for <i>intellectual pursuits</i>, and the means of attaining a liberal
education.&quot;&mdash;<i>Chancellor Harper of South Carolina on Slavery.</i>&mdash;<i>Southern
Literary Messenger, Oct. 1838.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Whatever may be the leisure enjoyed by the slaveholders, they
are careful not to afford the means of literary improvement to
their fellow-citizens who are too poor to possess slaves, and who
are, by their very ignorance, rendered more fit instruments for
doing the will, and guarding the human property of the wealthier
class.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span></p>

<h2>III. INDUSTRY AND ENTERPRISE.</h2>

<p class="indent">In a community so unenlightened as yours, it is a matter of
course, that the arts and sciences must languish, and the industry
and enterprise of the country be oppressed by a general torpor.
Hence multitudes will be without regular and profitable employment,
and be condemned to poverty and numberless privations.
The very advertisements in your newspapers show that, for a vast
proportion of the comforts and conveniences of life, you are dependent
on Northern manufacturers and mechanics. You both
know and feel that slavery has rendered labor disgraceful among
you; and where this is the case, industry is necessarily discouraged.
The great staple of the South is cotton; and we
have no desire to undervalue its importance. It, is however,
worthy of remark, that its cultivation affords a livelihood to only
a small proportion of the free inhabitants; and scarcely to any
of those we are now addressing. Cotton is the product of slave
labor, and its profits at home are confined almost exclusively to
the slaveholders. Yet on account of this article, we hear frequent
vaunts of the agricultural riches of the South. With the exception
of cotton, it is difficult to distinguish your agricultural products
arising from slaves, and from free labor. But admitting,
what we know is not the fact, that <i>all</i> the other productions of
the soil are raised <i>exclusively</i> by free labor, we learn from the
census, that the agricultural products of the North exceed those
of the South, cotton excepted, $226,219,714. Here then we
have an appalling proof of the paralyzing influence of slavery on
the industry of the whites.</p>

<p class="indent">In every community a large portion of the inhabitants are debarred
from drawing their maintenance directly from the cultivation
of the earth. Other and lucrative employments are reserved
for them. If the slaveholders chiefly engross the soil, let us see
how you are compensated by the encouragement afforded to
mechanical skill and industry.</p>

<p class="indent">Having already compared Ohio and Kentucky in reference to
population and education, we will pursue the comparison as to
agricultural and mechanical industry. On account of contiguity,
and similarity of extent, soil and climate, no two States can perhaps
be so aptly contrasted for the purpose of illustrating the
influence of slavery. It should also be borne in mind that Kentucky
can scarcely be called a cotton State, having in 1840
raised only 607,456&nbsp;lbs. of that article. Hence the deficiency of
agriculture and other products in Kentucky arises, not from a
peculiar species of cultivation, but solely from the withering effects
of slavery.</p>

<p class="indent">In one species of manufacture the South apparently excels the
North, but unfortunately it is in appearance only. Of 9657 distilleries
in the United States, no less than 7665 were found in the
slave States and Territories; but for want of skill and capital
these yield 1992 gallons less than the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Where there is so much ignorance and idleness, we may well
suppose that the inventive faculties will be but little exercised;
and accordingly we find that of the 545 patents granted for new
inventions in 1846, only 80 were received by the citizens of the
slave States. We have thus, fellow-citizens, offered you the testimony
of figures, as to the different state of society under freedom
and slavery; suffer us now to present you pictures of the two
regions, drawn not by abolitionists, but by Southern artists, in
unguarded hours. Mr. Clowney, of South Carolina, thus portrayed
his native State, in the ardor of debate on the floor of
Congress:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
&quot;Look at South Carolina now, with her houses deserted and
falling to decay; her once fruitful fields worn out and abandoned
for want of timely improvement or skilful cultivation; and her
thousands of acres of inexhaustible lands, still promising an abundant
harvest to the <i>industrious</i> husbandman, lying idle and neglected.
In the interior of the State where I was born, and
where I now live, although a country possessing all the advantages
of soil, climate and health, abounding in arable land, unreclaimed
from the first rude state of nature, there can now be
found many neighborhoods where the population is too sparse to
support a common elementary school for children. Such is the
deplorable condition of one of the oldest members of this Union,
that dates back its settlement more than a century and a half,
while other States, born as it were but yesterday, already surpass
what Carolina is or ever has been, in the happiest and
proudest day of her prosperity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This gentleman chose to attribute the decline of South Carolina
to the tariff; rather than to the obvious cause, that one-half
of the <span class="smcap">people</span> of South Carolina are poor, ignorant, degraded
<span class="smcap">slaves</span>, and the other half suffering in all their faculties and energies,
from a moral pestilence which they insanely regard as a
blessing and not a curse. Surely it is not owing to the tariff, that
this ancient member of the Union has 20,615 white citizens
over twenty years of age who do not know their letters; while
Maine, with double her population, has only 3,241.</p>

<p class="indent">Now look upon a very different picture. Mr. Preston, of South
Carolina, not long since delivered a speech at Columbia in reference
to a proposed rail-road. In this speech, in order to stimulate
the efforts of the friends of the road, he indulged in the
following strain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;No Southern man can journey (as he had lately done)
through the Northern States, and witness the prosperity, the
industry, the public spirit which they exhibit&mdash;the sedulous cultivation
of all those arts by which life is rendered comfortable
and respectable&mdash;without feelings of deep sadness and shame as
he remembers <i>his own neglected and desolate home</i>. There, no
dwelling is to be seen abandoned&mdash;not a farm uncultivated.
Every person and every thing performs a part towards the grand
result; and the whole land is covered with fertile fields, with
manufactories, and canals, and rail-roads, and edifices, and towns,
and cities. We of the South are mistaken in the character of
these people, when we think of them only as pedlars in horn flints
and bark nutmegs. Their energy and enterprise are directed to
all objects great and small within their reach. The number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
rail-roads and other modes of expeditious intercommunication knit
the whole country into a closely compacted mass, through which
the productions of commerce and of the press, the comforts of
life, and the means of knowledge, are universally diffused; while
the close intercourse of travel and of business makes all neighbors,
and promotes a common interest and a common sympathy.
How different the condition of these things in the South! <i>Here</i>
the face of the country wears the aspect of premature old age
and decay. <span class="smcap">No improvement is seen going on</span>, nothing is done
for posterity. No man thinks of anything beyond the present
moment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Yet this same Mr. Preston, thus sensitively alive to the superior
happiness and prosperity of the free States, declared in
the United States Senate, &quot;Let an abolitionist come within the
borders of South Carolina, if we can catch him we will try him,
and notwithstanding all the interference of all the governments of
the earth, including the Federal Government, we will <span class="smcap">hang</span>
him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In other words, the slaveholders, rather than part with
their slaves, are ready to murder, with all the formalities of law,
the very men who are laboring to confer on them the envied
blessings of the North.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_7_7">
<span class="label">[7]</span></a>We are well aware that Mr. Preston has denied, what no one asserted,
that he had said an abolitionist, if he came into South Carolina,
would be executed by Lynch law. He used the words we have quoted.

<h2>IV. FEELINGS OF THE SLAVEHOLDERS TOWARDS<br />
THE LABORING CLASSES.</h2>

<p class="indent">Whenever the great mass of the laboring population of a
country are reduced to beasts of burden, and toil under the lash,
&quot;bodily labor,&quot; as Chancellor Harper expresses it, must be disreputable,
from the mere influence of association. Hence you
know <i>white</i> laborers at the South are styled &quot;mean whites.&quot; At
the North, on the contrary, labor is regarded as the proper and
commendable means of acquiring wealth; and our most influential
men would in no degree suffer in public estimation, for holding
the plough, or even repairing the highways. Hence no poor man
is deterred from seeking a livelihood by honest labor from a dread
of personal degradation. The different light in which labor is
viewed at the North and the South is one cause of the depression
of industry in the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">Another cause is the ever-wakeful jealousy of your aristocracy.
They fear the <span class="smcap">people</span>; they are alarmed at the very idea of
power and influence being possessed by any portion of the community
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
not directly interested in slave property. Visions of
emancipation, of agrarianism, and of popular resistance to their
authority, are ever floating in their distempered and excited imaginations.
They know their own weakness, and are afraid you
should know it also. Hence it is their policy to keep down the
&quot;mean whites.&quot; Hence their philippics against the lower classes.
Hence their constant comparison of the laborers of the North,
with their own slaves; and hence, in no small degree, the absence
among you of those institutions which confer upon the poor that
knowledge which is <i>power</i>. Do you deem these assertions uncharitable?
Listen to their own declarations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;We believe the servitude which prevails in the South far
preferable to that of the <i>North</i>, or in Europe. Slavery will exist
in all communities. There is a class which may be nominally
free, but they will be virtually <i>Slaves</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Mississippian, July 6th,
1838.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those who depend on their daily labor for their daily subsistence
can never enter into political affairs: they never do, never
will, never can.&quot;&mdash;<i>B. W. Leigh in Virginia Convention, 1829.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All society settles down into a classification of capitalists and
laborers. The former will <i>own</i> the latter, either collectively
through the government, or individually in a state of domestic
servitude, as exists in the Southern States of this confederacy. If
<span class="smcap">laborers</span> ever obtain the political power of a country, it is in
fact in a state of <span class="smcap">revolution</span>. The capitalists north of Mason and
Dixon&#39;s line, have precisely the same interest in the labor of the
country, that the capitalists of England have in their labor.
Hence it is that they must have a strong federal government (!)
<i>to control</i> the labor of the nation. But it is precisely the reverse
with us. We have already not only a right to the proceeds of
our laborers, but we <span class="smcap">own</span> a <i>class of laborers</i> themselves. But let
me say to gentlemen who represent the great class of capitalists
in the North&mdash;beware that you do not drive us into a separate
system; for if you do, as certain as the decrees of heaven, you
will be compelled to <i>appeal to the sword to maintain yourselves
at home</i>. It may not come in your day; but your children&#39;s
children will be covered with the blood of domestic factions, and
will see <i>a plundering mob contending for power and conquest</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Mr.
Pickens, of South Carolina, in Congress, 21st Jan., 1836.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">So the way to prevent <i>plundering</i> mobs, is to enslave the
poor! We shall see presently, how far this expedient has been
successful in preventing <i>murdering</i> mobs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;In the very nature of things there must be classes of persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
to discharge all the different offices of society, from the highest
to the lowest. Some of these offices are regarded as <i>degrading</i>,
although they must and will be performed. Hence those manifest
forms of dependent servitude which produce a sense of superiority
in the masters or employers, and of inferiority on the part
of the servants. Where these offices are performed by <i>members
of the political community</i>, a <span class="smcap">dangerous element</span> is obviously
introduced into the body politic. Hence the alarming tendency
to violate the rights of property by agrarian legislation, which is
beginning to be manifest in the older States, where <span class="smcap">universal suffrage</span>
<i>prevails without</i> <span class="smcap">domestic slavery</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In a word, the institution of domestic slavery supersedes the
<i>necessity</i> of <span class="smcap">an order of nobility, and all the other appendages
of a hereditary system of government</span>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Governor
M&#39;Duffie&#39;s Message to the South Carolina Legislature, 1836.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We regard <span class="smcap">slavery</span> <i>as the most safe and stable basis for free
institutions in the world</i>. It is impossible with us, that the conflict
can take place between labor and capital, which makes it so
difficult to establish and maintain free institutions in all wealthy
and highly civilized nations where such institutions do not exist.
Every plantation is a little community with the master at its
head, who concentrates in himself the united interests of capital
and labor, <i>of which he is the common representative</i>.&quot;&mdash;(Mr. Calhoun,
of South Carolina, in the U. S. Senate, Jan. 10th, 1840.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We of the South have cause now, and shall soon have greater,
to congratulate ourselves on the existence of a population
among us, which excludes the <span class="smcap">Populace</span> which in effect rules
some of our Northern neighbors, and is rapidly gaining strength
wherever slavery does not exist&mdash;a populace made up of the
dregs of Europe, and the most worthless portion of the native
population.&quot;&mdash;(<i>Richmond Whig</i>, 1837.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you do a benefit to the horse or the ox by giving him
a cultivated understanding, a fine feeling? So far as the <span class="smcap">mere
laborer</span> has the pride, the knowledge, or the aspiration of a freeman,
he is unfitted for his situation. If there are sordid, servile,
<i>laborious</i> offices to be performed, is it not better that there should
be sordid, servile, laborious beings to perform them?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Odium has been cast upon our legislation, on account of its
forbidding the elements of education being communicated to
slaves. But in truth what injury is done them by this? <i>He who
works during the day with his hands</i>, does not read in the intervals
of leisure for his amusement, or the improvement of his
mind, or the exception is so very rare as scarcely to need the being
provided for.&quot;&mdash;(Chancellor Harper of South Carolina.&mdash;<i>Southern
Literary Messenger</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
This same gentleman delivered an oration on the 4th of July,
1840, reviewing the principles of the two great political parties,
and although he supported Mr. Van Buren&#39;s administration, in
consideration of its devotion to the slave interest, he frankly inquires:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Is there anything in the principles and opinions of the
great <span class="smcap">democratic rabble</span>, as it has been justly called, which
should induce <i>us</i> to identify ourselves with that? Here you
may find every possible grade and hue of opinion which has
ever existed in the country. Here you may find loafer, and loco
foco, and agrarian, and all the rabble of the city of New York,
the most corrupt and depraved of rabbles, and which controls, in
a great degree, the city itself, and through that, as being the
commercial metropolis, exercises much influence over the State
at large.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are the essential principles of democracy as distinguished
from republicanism? The first consists in the dogma, so
portentous to us, of the natural equality and unalienable right to
liberty of every human being. Our allies (!) no doubt, are willing
at <i>present</i> to modify the doctrine in <i>our favor</i>. But the spirit
of democracy at large makes no such exceptions, nor will these
(our allies, the Northern democrats) continue to make it, longer
than necessity or <i>interest</i> may require. The second consists in
the doctrine of the divine right of majorities; a doctrine not less
false, and slavish, and absurd, than the ancient doctrine of the divine
right of kings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Mr. Robert Wickliffe, of Kentucky, in a speech published in
the <i>Louisville Advertiser</i>, in opposition to those who were adverse
to the importation of slaves from the States, thus discourseth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen wanted to drive out the black population, that
they may obtain <span class="smcap">white negroes</span> in their place. <span class="smcap">White negroes</span>
have this advantage over black negroes, they can be converted
into voters; and the men who live upon the sweat of their brow,
and pay them but a dependent and scanty subsistence, can, if able
to keep ten thousand of them in employment, come up to the
polls and change the destiny of the country.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How improved will be our condition when we have such
white negroes as perform the servile labors of Europe, of Old
England, and he would add now of <i>New England</i>; when our
body servants and our cart drivers and our street sweepers are
<i>white negroes</i> instead of black. Where will be the independence,
the proud spirit, and the chivalry of Kentuckians then?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Had the gentleman looked across the river, he might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
found an answer to his question, in the wealth, power, intelligence
and happiness of Ohio.</p>

<p class="indent">In reading the foregoing extracts, it is amusing to observe how
adroitly the slaveholders avoid all recognition of any other classes
among them than masters and slaves. Who would suspect from
their language, that they were themselves a small minority of the
white inhabitants, and that their own &quot;white negroes&quot; could, if
united and so disposed, outvote them at the polls? It is worthy
of remark that in their denunciations of the <i>populace</i>, the <i>rabble</i>,
<i>those who work with their hands</i>, they refer not to complexion, but
to condition; not to slaves, but to the poor and laborious of their
own color. It is these haughty aristocrats who find in Northern
democrats &quot;allies,&quot; who in Congress and out of it are zealous in
obeying their mandates, and who may justly be termed their
&quot;white negroes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slavery, although considered by Mr. Calhoun &quot;the most stable
basis of free institutions in the world,&quot; has, as we shall presently
show you, in fact, led to grosser outrages in the social compact, to
more alarming violations of constitutional liberty, to more bold
and reckless assaults upon &quot;free institutions,&quot; than have ever
been even attempted by the much-dreaded agrarianism of the
North.</p>

<h2>V. STATE OF RELIGION.</h2>

<p class="indent">The deplorable ignorance and want of industry at the South,
together with the disrepute in which honest industry is held, cannot
but exercise, in connection with other causes, a most unhappy
influence on the morals of the inhabitants. You have among
you between two and three millions of slaves, who are kept by
law in brutal ignorance, and who, with few exceptions, are virtually
heathens.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_8_8">
<span class="label">[8]</span></a>
&quot;From long continued and close observation, we believe that their
(the slaves&#39;) moral and religious condition is such that they may justly
be considered the <span class="smcap">Heathen</span> of this Christian country, and will bear
comparison with heathen in any country in the world. The negroes
are destitute of the Gospel, and ever will be under the present state of
things.&quot;&mdash;<i>Report published by the Synod of South Carolina and Georgia,
Dec. 3, 1833.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">You have also among you more than 200,000 free negroes,
thus described by Mr. Clay:&mdash;&quot;Contaminated themselves, they
extend their vices to all around them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>

<i>Speech before the American Colonization Society.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">If evil communications corrupt good manners, the intimate intercourse
of the whites with these people must be depraving: nor
can the exercise of despotic power by the masters, their wives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
and children be otherwise than unfavorable to the benevolent affections.</p>

<p class="indent">It is with pain we are compelled to add, that the conduct and
avowed sentiments of the Southern clergy in relation to Slavery,
necessarily exert an unhappy influence. Most of the clergy are
themselves slaveholders, and are thus personally interested in the
system, and are consequently bold and active in justifying it from
Scripture, representing it as an institution enjoying the divine
sanction. An English author, in reference to these efforts of your
clergy, forcibly remarks: &quot;Whatever may have been the unutterable
wickedness of slavery in the West Indies, <i>there</i> it never
was baptized in the Redeemer&#39;s hallowed name, and its corruptions
were not concealed in the garb of religion. That acmé of
piratical turpitude was reserved for the professed disciples of
Jesus in America.&quot; And well has John Quincy Adams said,
&quot;The spirit of slavery has acquired not only an overruling ascendency,
but it has become at once intolerant, proscriptive, and
sophistical. It has crept into the philosophical chairs of the
schools. Its cloven hoof has ascended the pulpits of the churches&mdash;professors
of colleges teach it as a lesson of morals&mdash;ministers
of the Gospel seek and profess to find sanctions for it in the Word
of God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Your ministers live in the midst of slavery, and they <i>know</i> that
the system on which they bestow their benedictions, is, in the
language of Wilberforce, &quot;a system of the grossest injustice, of
the most heathenish irreligion and immorality; of the most unprecedented
degradation and unrelenting cruelty.&quot; Surely, we
have reason to fear that the denunciation of Scripture against
false prophets of old, will be accomplished against the Southern
clergy, &quot;Because they ministered unto them before their idols,
and caused the House of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore have
I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they
shall bear their iniquity.&quot;&mdash;<i>Ezek</i>. 44: 12.</p>

<p class="indent">Under such ministrations it cannot be expected that Christian
zeal and benevolence will take deep root and bear very abundant
fruit. This is a subject on which few statistics can be obtained.
We have no means of ascertaining the number of churches and
ministers throughout the United States of the various denominations.
Some opinion, however, may be formed of the religious
character of a people, by their efforts for the moral improvement
of the community. In the United States there are numerous
voluntary associations for religious and benevolent purposes, receiving
large contributions and exercising a wide moral influence.
Now, of all the large benevolent societies professing to promote
the welfare of the whole country, and asking and receiving contributions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
from all parts of it, we recollect but one that had its
origin in the slave region, and the business of which is transacted
in it, and that is the <span class="smcap">American Colonization Society</span>. Of the
real object and practical tendency of this Society it is unnecessary
to speak&mdash;you understand them.</p>

<p class="indent">In the 10th Report of the American Sunday School Union
[p. 50] is a table showing the number of Sunday School scholars
in each State for the year 1834. From this table we learn that</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="scholars">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">There were in the free States</td>
<td class="tdr">504,835 scholars.</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdl">&quot; &quot; slave &quot;</td>
<td class="tdr">82,532 &quot;</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdl">The single State of New York had</td>
<td class="tdr">161,768 &quot;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>about twice as many as in the thirteen slave States!</p>

<p class="indent">And is it possible that the literary and religious destitution you
are suffering, together with the vicious habits of your colored
population, should have no effect on the moral character of the
whites?</p>

<p class="indent">We entreat your patient and dispassionate attention to the remarks
and facts we are about to submit to you on the next subject
of inquiry.</p>

<h2>VI. STATE OF MORALS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Christianity, by controlling the malignant passions of our nature,
and exciting its benevolent affections, gives a sacredness to
the rights of others, and especially does it guard human life.
But where her blessed influence is withdrawn, or greatly impaired,
the passions resume their sway, and violence and cruelty become
the characteristics of every community in which the civil
authority is too feeble to afford protection.</p>

<p class="indent">No society is free from vices and crime, and we well know that
human depravity springs from another source than slavery. It
will not, however, be denied that circumstances and institutions
may check those evil propensities to which we are all prone; and
it will, we presume, be admitted that in forming an opinion of the
moral condition and advancement of any community, we are to
be guided in our judgment, not by insulated facts, but by the
<i>tone of public opinion</i>. Atrocities occur in the best regulated
and most virtuous States, but in such they excite indignation and
are visited with punishment; while in vicious communities they
are treated with levity and impunity.</p>

<p class="indent">In a country where suffrage is universal, the representatives
will but reflect the general character of their constituents. If
we are permitted to apply this rule in testing the moral condition
of the South, the result will not be favorable.</p>

<p class="indent">In noticing the public conduct of public men, we are not sensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
of violating any principle of courtesy or delicacy; we touch
not their private character or their private acts; we refer to their
language and sentiments, merely as one indication of the standard
of morals among their constituents, not as conclusive proof apart
from other evidence.</p>

<p class="indent">On the l5th February, 1837, R. M. Whitney was arraigned
before the House of Representatives for contempt in refusing to
attend when required before a Committee. His apology was that
he was afraid of his life, and he called, as a witness in his behalf,
one of the Committee, Mr. Fairfield, since Governor of the State
of Maine. It appeared that in the Committee, Mr. Peyton of
Virginia had put some interrogatory to Whitney, who had returned
a written answer which was deemed offensive. On this,
as Mr. Fairfield testified, Peyton addressed the Chairman in these
terms, &quot;Mr. Chairman, I wish you to inform this witness, that he
is not to insult me in his answers: if he does, God damn him! I
will take his life on the spot!&quot; Whitney rose and said he claimed
the protection of the Committee, on which Peyton exclaimed,
&quot;God damn you, you shan&#39;t speak, you shan&#39;t say one word
while you are in this room, if you do I will put you to death!&quot;
Soon after, Peyton observing that Whitney was looking at him,
cried out, &quot;Damn him, his eyes are on me&mdash;God damn him, he is
looking at me&mdash;he shan&#39;t do it&mdash;damn him, he shan&#39;t look at me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The newspaper reports of the proceedings of Congress, a
few years since, informed us that Mr. Dawson, a member from
Louisiana, went up to Mr. Arnold, another member, and said
to him, &quot;If you attempt to speak, or rise from your seat, sir,
by God I&#39;ll cut your throat!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a debate on the Florida war, Mr. Cooper having taken offence
at Mr. Giddings of Ohio, for some remarks relative to
slavery, said in his reply, &quot;If the gentleman from Ohio will come
among my constituents and promulgate his doctrines there, he will
find that Lynch law will be inflicted, and that the gentleman will
reach an elevation which he little dreams of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the session of 1841, Mr. Payne, of Alabama, in debate,
alluding to the abolitionists, among whom he insisted the Postmaster-General
ought to be included, declared that he would proscribe
all abolitionists, he &quot;would put the brand of Cain upon
them&mdash;yes, the mark of <span class="smcap">Hell</span>, and if they came to the South he
would <span class="smcap">hang them like dogs</span>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hammond, of South Carolina, at an earlier period thus
expressed himself in the House: &quot;I warn the abolitionists,
ignorant, infatuated barbarians as they are, that if chance shall
throw any of them into our hands, they may expect a <span class="smcap">felon&#39;s
death</span>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
In 1848, Mr. Hale, a Senator from New Hampshire, introduced
a bill for the protection of property in the District of Columbia,
attempts having been made to destroy an anti-Slavery press. Mr.
Foote, a Senator from Mississippi, thus expressed himself in
reply: &quot;I invite him (Mr. H.) to the State of Mississippi, and
will tell him before-hand, in all honesty, that he could not go ten
miles into the interior, before he would grace one of the tallest
trees of the forest, with a rope around his neck, with the approbation
of every virtuous and patriotic citizen, and that, if necessary,
<span class="smcap">I should myself assist in the operation</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And now, fellow-citizens, do these men, with all their profanity
and vulgarity, breathing out threatenings and slaughter, represent
the feelings, and manners, and morals of the slaveholding community?
We have seen no evidence that they have lost a particle
of popular favor in consequence of their ferocious violence.
Alas! their language has been re-echoed again and again by public
meetings in the slave States; and we proceed to lay before
you overwhelming proof that in the expression of their murderous
feelings towards the abolitionists, they have faithfully represented
the sentiments of their constituents.</p>

<h2>VII. DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE.</h2>

<p class="indent">We have already seen that one of the blessings which the
slaveholders attribute to their favorite institution, is exemption
from popular tumults, and from encroachments by the democracy
upon the rights of property. Their argument is, that political
power in the hands of the poor and laboring classes is always attended
with danger, and that this danger is averted when these classes
are kept in bondage. With these gentlemen, life and liberty seem
to be accounted as the small dust of the balance, when weighed
against slavery and plantations; hence, to preserve the latter
they are ever ready to sacrifice the former, in utter defiance of
laws and constitutions.</p>

<p class="indent">We have already noticed the murderous proposition in relation
to abolitionists, made by Governor M&#39;Duffie to the South Carolina
Legislature in 1835: &quot;It is my deliberate opinion that the <i>laws</i>
of every community should punish this species of interference,
by <span class="smcap">death</span> without benefit of clergy.&quot; In an address to a legislative
assembly, Governor M&#39;Duffie refrained from the indecency
of recommending <i>illegal</i> murder; but we will soon find that the
public sentiment of the South by no means requires that abolitionists
shall be put to death with legal formalities; but on the
contrary, the slaveholders are ready, in the language of Mr. Payne,
to &quot;hang them like dogs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
We hazard little in the assertion, that in no civilized Christian
community on earth is human life less protected by law, or more
frequently taken with impunity, than in the slave States of the
Federal Union. We wish to impress upon you the danger and
corruption to which you and your children are exposed from the
institution, which, as we have shown you, exists by your sufferance.
But you have been taught to respect this institution;
and hence it becomes necessary to enter into details, however
painful, and to present you with authorities which you cannot reject.
What we have just said of the insecurity of human life,
will probably be deemed by you and others as abolition slander.
Listen, then, to slaveholders themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We long to see the day,&quot; said the Governor of Kentucky in
his message to the Legislature, 1837, &quot;when the law will assert
its majesty, and stop the wanton destruction of life which almost
<i>daily</i> occurs within the jurisdiction of this commonwealth. <span class="smcap">Men
slaughter each other with almost perfect impunity.</span>  A
species of common law has grown up in Kentucky, which, were it
written down, would, in all civilized countries, cause her to be
re-christened, in derision, <span class="smcap">the land of blood</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The present Bishop of the Episcopal Church in Kentucky<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a
few years since, published an article on the murders in that State.
He states that some with whom he had conversed, estimated
them at 80 per annum; but that he had rated them at about
30; and that he had ascertained that for the last three years,
there had not been &quot;an instance of capital punishment in any
<i>white</i> offender.&quot; &quot;It is believed,&quot; says he, &quot;there are more
homicides on an average of two years in <i>any</i> of our more populous
<i>counties</i>, than in the whole of several of our <i>States</i> of equal,
or nearly equal, population to Kentucky.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Governor McVay, of Alabama, in his message to the Legislature,
November 15, 1837, thus speaks, &quot;We hear of homicides
in different parts of the State continually, and yet have few convictions
and still fewer executions! Why do we hear of stabbings
and shootings almost <i>daily</i> in some part or other of our
State?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Death by Violence.</span>&mdash;The moral atmosphere in our State
appears to be in a deleterious and sanguinary condition. Almost
every exchange paper which reaches us, contains some inhuman
and revolting case of murder, or death by violence. <i>Not less than</i>

<span class="smcap">Contempt of Human Life.</span>&mdash;In view of the crimes which are
daily committed, we are led to inquire whether it is owing to the
inefficiency of our laws, or to the manner in which these laws are
administered, that this <span class="smcap">frightful deluge of human blood
flows through our streets and our places of public resort</span>.&mdash;<i>New
Orleans Bee, 23d May, 1838.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">At the opening of the Criminal Court in New Orleans, November
4th, 1837, Judge Lansuque delivered an address, in which,
speaking of the prevalence of violence, he used the following language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;As a Louisiana parent, I reflect with terror, that our beloved
children, reared to become one day honorable and useful
citizens, may be the victims of these votaries of vice and licentiousness.
Without some powerful and certain remedy, our
streets will become <span class="smcap">butcheries, overflowing with the blood of
our citizens</span>!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">While the slaveholders are terrified at the idea of the &quot;great
democratic rabble,&quot; and rejoice in human bondage as superseding
the necessity of an &quot;order of nobility, and all the appendages of
a hereditary government,&quot; they have established a reign of terror,
as insurrectionary and as sanguinary in principle, as that created
by the sans culottes of the French revolution. We indulge in no
idle declamation, but speak the words of truth and soberness.</p>

<p class="indent">A public meeting, convened in the <i>church</i>!! in the town of
Clinton, Mississippi, 5th September, 1835&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Resolved, &quot;That it is our decided opinion, that any individual
who dares to circulate, with a view to effectuate the designs of
the abolitionists, any of the incendiary tracts or newspapers now
in the course of transmission to this country, is justly worthy, in
the sight of God and man, of immediate death; and we doubt
not that such would be the punishment of any such offender, in
any part of the State of Mississippi where he may be found.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It would be tedious to copy the numerous resolutions of similar
import, passed by public meetings in almost every slave State.
You well know that the promoters of those lawless and sanguinary
proceedings, did not belong to the &quot;rabble&quot;&mdash;they
were not &quot;mean whites,&quot; but rich, influential slaveholders. A
meeting was held in 1835 at Williamsburgh, Virginia, which was
harangued by no less a personage than <span class="smcap">John Tyler</span>, once
Governor of the State, and since <i>President of the United States</i>:
under this gentleman&#39;s auspices, and after his address, the meeting
resolved&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;That we regard the printing and circulating within our limits, of
incendiary publications, tending to excite our slaves to insurrection
and rebellion, as treasonable acts of the most alarming character,
and that when we detect offenders in the act, we will inflict
upon them condign punishment, without resorting to any other
tribunal.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The profligacy of this resolution needs no comment. Mr. Tyler
well knew that the laws of Virginia, and every other State
were abundantly sufficient to punish crime: but he and his fellow
lynchers wished to deter the people from receiving and reading
anything adverse to slavery; and hence, with their usual audacity,
they determined to usurp the prerogative of courts and juries,
and throw down all the bulwarks which the law has erected for
the protection of innocence.</p>

<p class="indent">Newspapers are regarded as the mirrors of public opinion.
Let us see what opinions are reflected in those of the South.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The <i>Charleston Courier</i>, 11th August, 1835, declared that
&quot;the <i>gallows and the stake</i>&quot; awaited the abolitionists who should
dare to &quot;appear in person among us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The cry of the whole South should be death, instant death
to the abolitionist, wherever he is caught.&quot;&mdash;<i>Augusta (Geo.)
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us declare through the public journals of our country,
that the question of slavery is not and shall not be open to discussion;
that the system is too deep-rooted among us, and must
remain for ever; that the very moment any private individual attempts
to lecture us upon its evils and immorality, and the necessity
of putting means in operation to secure us from them, in the
same moment his tongue shall be cut out and cast upon the
dunghill.&quot;&mdash;<i>Columbia (S.C.) Telescope.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This, it will be noticed, is a threat addressed, not to the Northern
abolitionists, but to <i>you</i>, fellow-citizens, to the great majority of
the white inhabitants of the South; and <i>you</i> are warned not to
express <i>an opinion</i> offensive to your aristocracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Awful but Just Punishment.</span>&mdash;We learn, by the arrival of
the steamboat Kentucky last evening from Richmond, that Robinson,
the Englishman mentioned in the <i>Beacon</i> of Saturday, as being
in the vicinity of Lynchburg, was taken about fifteen miles
from that town, and <span class="smcap">hanged</span> on the spot, for exciting the slaves
to insurrection.&quot;&mdash;<i>Norfolk (Va.) Beacon, 10th August, 1835.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can assure the Bostonians, one and all, who have embarked
in the nefarious scheme of abolishing slavery at the South,

that lashes will hereafter be spared the backs of their emissaries.
Let them send out their men to Louisiana; they will never return

<p class="indent">&quot;Abolition editors in slave States will not dare to avow their
opinions. It would be instant <span class="smcap">death</span> to them.&quot;&mdash;<i>Missouri Argus.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Here, again, is a threat directed against any of <i>you</i>, who may
happen to have the command of types and printer&#39;s ink.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, we ask what must be the state of society, where the
public journals thus justify and stimulate the public thirst for
blood? The very idea of <i>trial</i> is scouted, and the mob, or rather
the slaveholders themselves, are acknowledged to be the arbiters
of life and death. The question we put to you as to the <i>state of
society</i>, has been already answered by the official declarations of
the Governors of Kentucky and Alabama, and of Judge Lansuque,
of New Orleans; as well as by the extracts we have given
you from some of the southern journals, relative to the frequency
of murders among them. We could farther answer it, by filling
sheets with accounts of fearful atrocities. But we purposely refrain
from referring to assassinations and private crimes; for such,
as already remarked, occur in a greater or less degree in every
community, and do not necessarily form a test of the standard
of morals. But we ask your attention to a test which cannot be
questioned. We will present for your consideration a series of
atrocities, perpetrated, not by individuals in secret, but in open
day by the <i>slaveholding populace</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">We have seen that two of the Southern papers we have quoted,
threaten abolitionists with <span class="smcap">the stake</span>. This awful and horrible
punishment has been banished, by the progress of civilization,
from the whole of Christendom, with the single exception of the
American Slave States. It is scarcely necessary to say, that
even in them, it is unknown to the laws, although familiar to the
people. It is also deserving of remark, that the two journals
which have made this atrocious threat were published, not among
the rude borderers of our frontier settlements, but in the populous
cities of Charleston and New-Orleans, the very centres of
Southern refinement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Tuscaloosa</span> (Alab.) June 20, 1827. The negro [one who
had killed a Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Neilly was taken before a Justice of the
Peace, who <i>waived his authority</i>, perhaps through fear, as a
crowd of persons had collected, to the number of seventy or
eighty, near Mr. People&#39;s [the Justice] house. He acted as President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
of the mob, and put the vote, when it was decided that he
should be immediately executed by being <i>burned to death</i>. The
sable culprit was led to a tree and tied to it, and a large quantity
of pine knots collected and placed around him, and the fatal torch
applied to the pile, even against the remonstrances of several
gentlemen who were present, and the miserable being was in a
short time burned to ashes. This is the <i>second</i> negro who has been
<i>thus</i> put to death, without judge or jury in this country.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">On the 28th of April, 1836, a free negro was arrested in St.
Louis (Missouri) and committed to jail on a charge of murder.
A mob assembled and demanded him of the jailor, who surrendered
him. The negro was then chained to a tree <i>a short distance
from the Court House</i>, and burned to death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;After the flames had surrounded their prey, and when his
clothes were in a blaze all over him, his eyes burnt out of his
head, and his mouth seemingly parched to a cinder, some one in
the <i>crowd</i>, more compassionate than the rest, proposed to put an
end to his misery by shooting him, when it was replied that it
would be of no use, since he was already out of his pain. &#39;No,&#39;
said the wretch, &#39;I am not, I am suffering as much as ever; shoot
me, shoot me.&#39; &#39;No, no,&#39; said one of the fiends who was standing
about the sacrifice they were roasting, &#39;he shall not be shot,
I would sooner slacken the fire, if that would increase his misery;&#39;
and the man who said this was, we understand, an <i>officer of justice</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Alton
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have been informed that the slave William, who murdered
his master (Huskey) some weeks since, was taken by a party a
few days since <i>from the Sheriff</i> of Hot Spring, and <i>burned alive</i>!
yes, tied up to the limb of a tree and a fire built under him, and
consumed in a slow lingering torture.&quot;&mdash;<i>Arkansas Gazette, Oct.</i>
29. 1836.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The <i>Natchez Free Trader, 16th June, 1842</i>, gives a horrible
account of the execution of the negro, Joseph, on the 5th of that
month for murder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The body,&quot; says that paper, &quot;was taken and chained to a tree
immediately on the bank of the Mississippi, on what is called
Union Point. The torches were lighted and placed in the pile.
He watched unmoved the curling flame as it grew, until it began
to entwine itself around and feed upon his body; then he sent
forth cries of agony painful to the ear, begging some one to blow
his brains out; at the same time surging with almost superhuman
strength, until the staple with which the chain was fastened to
the tree, not being well secured, drew out, and he leaped from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
the burning pile. At that moment the sharp ring of several
rifles was heard, and the body of the negro fell a corpse to the
ground. He was picked up by two or three, and again thrown
into the fire and consumed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Another Negro Burned.</span>&mdash;We learn from the clerk of the
Highlander that, while wooding a short distance below the mouth
of Red river, they were <i>invited to stop a short time and see another
negro burned</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>N. O. Bulletin.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Thus we see that burning negroes alive is treated as a spectacle,
and strangers are invited to witness it. The victim of this
exhibition was the negro Enoch, said to have been an accomplice
of Joseph, and was burned a few days after the other.</p>

<p class="indent">We have thus given you no less than <i>six</i> instances of human
beings publicly burned alive in four slave States, and in each case
with entire impunity to the miscreants engaged in the horrible
murder. But these were cases which <i>happened</i> to be reported in
the newspapers, and with which we <i>happened</i> to become acquainted.
There is reason to believe that these executions are
not of rare occurrence, and that many of them, either through
indifference or policy, are not noticed in the Southern papers.</p>

<p class="indent">A recent traveller remarks, &quot;Just before I reached Mobile, two
men were <i>burned alive</i> there in a slow fire in the open air, in the
presence of the <i>gentlemen</i> of the city. No word was breathed of
the transaction in the newspapers.&quot;&mdash;<i>Martineau&#39;s Society in
America</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">i.</span>, p. 373.</p>

<p class="indent">But the murderous spirit deplored by the Governors of Kentucky
and Alabama, and the &quot;frightful deluge of human blood&quot;
complained of by the New Orleans editor, had no reference to the
murder of <i>negroes</i>. Men who can enjoy the sight of negroes
writhing in flames, and are permitted by the civil authorities to
indulge in such exhibitions, will not be very scrupulous in taking
the lives of each other. You well know how incessantly the
work of human slaughter is going on among you: and no reader
of your public journals can be ignorant of the frequent occurrence
of your deadly street fights. But, for the reason already given,
we meddle not with these. We charge the slaveholding community,
as such, with <i>sanctioning</i> murder, and protecting the perpetrators,
and setting the laws at defiance. This we know is a
grievous charge, and most grievous the proof of it. But mistake
not our meaning. God forbid we should deny that many of the
community to which we refer, utterly abhor the atrocities we are
about to detail. We speak of the murderous feelings of the
slaveholding community, just as we speak of the politics, the
manners, and the morals of any other community, freely acknowledging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
that there are numerous and honorable exceptions. For
the general truth of our assertion, we appeal to the authorities
and the facts we have already laid before you, and to those we
are about to offer.</p>

<p class="indent">You have already seen that the pro-slavery press has recommended
the murder of such northern abolitionists as may be
caught in the South; we now ask your attention to the efforts made
by the slaveholders to get prominent abolitionists into their power.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1831, a citizen of Massachusetts established a newspaper
at Boston, called the Liberator, and devoted to the cause of negro
emancipation. The undertaking was perfectly legal, and he himself,
having never been in Georgia, had of course violated none
of her laws. The legislature, however, forthwith passed a law,
offering a bribe of $5000 to any person who would arrest and
bring to trial and conviction, in Georgia, the editor and publisher
of the Boston paper. This most atrocious law was &quot;approved&quot;
on the 26th Dec., 1831, by <span class="smcap">William Lumpkin</span>, the
Governor. The object of the bribe could have been no other
than the abduction and murder of the conductor of the paper&mdash;his
<i>trial</i> and <i>conviction</i> under Georgia laws being a mere pretence:
the Georgia courts have as much jurisdiction over the Press in
Paris as in Boston. A Lynch court was the only one that could
have taken cognizance of the offence, and its proceedings would
undoubtedly have been both summary and sanguinary.</p>

<p class="indent">The horrible example thus set by the Georgia Legislature was
not without its followers.</p>

<p class="indent">At a meeting of slaveholders at Sterling, Sept. 4, 1835, it was
formally recommended to the Governor to issue a proclamation,
offering the $5000 appropriated by the Act of 1831, as a reward
for the apprehension of <i>either</i> of <i>ten</i> persons named in the resolution,
citizens of New York and Massachusetts, and one a subject
of Great Britain; not one of whom it was even pretended
had ever set his foot on the soil of Georgia.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Milledgeville [Ga.] Federal Union</i>, of Feb. 1, 1836, contained
an offer of $10,000 for kidnapping A. A. Phelps, a clergyman
residing in the city of New York.</p>

<p class="indent">The Committee of Vigilance of the Parish of East Feliciana,
offered in the Louisiana Journal of 15th Oct., 1835, $50,000 to
any person who would deliver <i>into their hands</i> Arthur Tappan, a
New York merchant.</p>

<p class="indent">At a public meeting of the citizens of Mount Meigs, Alabama,
13th August, 1836, the Honorable [!] Bedford Ginress in the
chair, a reward of $50,000 was offered for the apprehension of
Arthur Tappan, or Le Roy Sunderland, a clergyman of the
Methodist Church residing in New York.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Let us now witness the practical operation of that murderous
spirit which dictated the foregoing villainous bribes. We have
already seen the conduct of the slave-holding community to <i>negro</i>
offenders; we are now to notice its tender mercies to men of its
own color.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1835, there was a real or affected apprehension of a
servile insurrection in the State of Mississippi. The slaveholders,
as usual on such occasions, were exceedingly frightened, and
were exceedingly cruel. A pamphlet was afterwards published,
entitled &quot;<i>Proceedings of the Citizens of Madison County,
Miss., at Livingston, in July, 1835, in relation to the trial
and punishment of several individuals implicated in a contemplated
insurrection in this State.&mdash;Prepared by Thomas
Shuckelford, Esquire. Printed at Jackson, Miss.</i>&quot; This pamphlet,
then, is the <i>Southern</i> account of the affair; and while it is
more minute in its details than the narratives published in the
newspapers at the time, we are not aware that it contradicts
them. It may be regarded as a sort of semi-official report put
forth by the slaveholders, and published under their implied sanction.
It appears, from this account, that in consequence of &quot;rumors&quot;
that the slaves meditated an insurrection&mdash;that a colored
girl had been heard to say that &quot;she was tired of waiting on the
white folks&mdash;wanted to be her own mistress for the balance of
her days, and clean up her own house, &amp;c.,&quot; a meeting was held
at which resolutions were signed, organizing a committee, and
authorizing them &quot;<i>to bring before them any person or persons,
either white or black, and try in a summary manner any person
brought before them, with power to hang or whip, being always
governed by the laws of the land, so far only as they shall be applicable
to the case in question; otherwise to act as in their discretion
shall seem best for the benefit of the country and the protection of
its citizens</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was certainly a most novel mode of erecting and commissioning
a Court of judicature, with the power of life and death, expressly
authorized to act independently of &quot;the laws of the land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Constitution of the State of Mississippi, which no doubt
many of the honorable Judges of the Court had on other occasions
taken an oath to support, contains the following clause:&mdash;&quot;No
person shall be accused, arrested or detained, except in
cases ascertained by law, and according to the forms which the
same has prescribed; and no person shall be punished, but in virtue
of a law established and promulgated prior to the offence,
and legally applied.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Previous</i> to the organization of this Court, <span class="smcap">five</span> slaves had already
been <span class="smcap">hung</span> by the people. The Court, or rather, as it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
modestly called by the meeting who erected it, &quot;the committee,&quot;
proceeded to try Dr. Joshua Cotton, of New England. It was
proved to the satisfaction of the committee that he had been detected
in many low tricks&mdash;that he was deficient in feeling and affection
for his second wife&mdash;that he had traded with negroes&mdash;that
he had asked a negro boy whether the slaves were whipped
much, how he would like to be free? &amp;c. It is <i>stated</i> that Cotton
made a confession that he had been aiming to bring about a conspiracy.
The committee condemned him <span class="smcap">to be hanged in an
hour after sentence</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">William Saunders, a native of Tennessee, was next tried. He
was convicted &quot;of being often out at night, and giving no satisfactory
explanation for so doing&quot;&mdash;of equivocal conduct&mdash;of being
intimate with Cotton, &amp;c. Whereupon, by a unanimous vote,
he was found guilty and sentenced to be <span class="smcap">hung</span>. He was executed
with Cotton on the 4th of July.</p>

<p class="indent">Albe Dean, of Connecticut, was next tried. He was convicted
of being a lazy, indolent man, having very little <i>pretensions</i> to
honesty&mdash;of &quot;pretending to make a living by constructing washing
machines&quot;&mdash;of &quot;often coming to the owners of runaways, to
intercede with the masters to save them from a whipping.&quot; He
was sentenced to be <span class="smcap">hung</span>, and was executed.</p>

<p class="indent">A. L. Donavan, of Kentucky, was then put on his trial. He
was suspected of having traded with the negroes&mdash;of being found
in their cabins, and enjoying himself in their Society. It was
proved that &quot;at one time he actually undertook to release a
negro who was tied, which negro afterwards implicated him,&quot;
and that he once told an overseer &quot;it was cruel work to be
whipping the poor negroes as he was obliged to do.&quot; The committee
were satisfied, from the evidence before them, that Donavan
was an emissary of those deluded fanatics of the North,
the abolitionists. He was condemned to be <span class="smcap">hung</span>, and suffered
accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruel Blake was next tried, condemned and <span class="smcap">hung</span>. &quot;He protested
his innocence to the last, and said his life was sworn
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here we have a record of no less than <span class="smcap">ten</span> men, five black
and five white, probably all innocent of the crime alleged against
them, deliberately and publicly put to death by the slaveholders,
without the shadow of legal authority.</p>

<p class="indent">The Maysville, Ken. Gazette, in announcing Donavan&#39;s murder,
says, &quot;he formerly belonged to Maysville, and was a much
respected citizen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A letter from Donavan to his wife, written just before his
execution, and published in the Maysville paper, says, &quot;I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
doomed to die to-morrow at 12 o&#39;clock, on a charge of having
been concerned in a negro insurrection, in this State, among
many other whites. We are not tried by a regular jury, but
by a committee of <span class="smcap">planters</span> appointed for the purpose, who have
not time to wait on a person for evidence.... Now I must
close by saying, before my Maker and Judge, that I go into his
presence as innocent of this charge as when I was born....
I must bid you a final farewell, hoping that the God of the
widow and the fatherless will give you grace to bear this most
awful sentence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And now, did these butcheries by the Mississippi <span class="smcap">planters</span>
excite the indignation of the slaveholding communities? Receive
the answer from an editor of the Ancient Dominion, replying to
the comments of a Northern newspaper. &quot;The Journal may
depend upon it that the Cottons and the Saunders, men confessing
themselves guilty of inciting and plotting insurrection,
will be <span class="smcap">hanged up</span> wherever caught, and that <i>without the formality
of a legal trial</i>. Northern or Southern, such will be their
inevitable doom. For our part, <span class="smcap">we applaud</span> the transaction, and
none in our opinion can condemn it, who have not a secret sympathy
with the Garrison sect. If Northern sympathy and effort
are to be cooled and extinguished by such cases, it proves but
this, that the South ought to feel little confidence in the professions
it receives from that quarter.&quot;&mdash;<i>Richmond Whig.</i></p>

<p class="indent">About the time of the massacre in Clinton County, another
awful tragedy was performed at Vicksburg in the same State.
<span class="smcap">Five</span> men, said to be <i>gamblers</i>, were <span class="smcap">hanged</span> by the mob on the
5th July, in open day.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Louisiana Advertiser</i>, of 13th July, says, &quot;These unfortunate
men claimed to the last, the privilege of American citizens, the
<i>trial by Jury</i>, and professed themselves willing to submit to anything
their country would legally inflict upon them: but we are
sorry to say, their petition was in vain. The black musicians
were ordered to strike up, and the voices of the supplicants were
drowned by the fife and drum. <i>Mr. Riddle, the Cashier of the
Planters&#39; Bank</i>, ordered them to play Yankee Doodle. The
unhappy sufferers frequently implored a drink of water, <i>but they
were refused</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sympathy of the Louisiana editor, so different from his
brother of Richmond, was probably owing to the fact, that the
murdered men were accused of being gamblers, and not abolitionists.</p>

<p class="indent">When we said these five men were hung by the <i>mob</i>, we did
not mean what Chancellor Harper calls &quot;the democratic rabble.&quot;
It seems the Cashier of a Bank, a man to whom the slaveholders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
entrust the custody of their money, officiated on the occasion as
Master of Ceremonies.</p>

<p class="indent">A few days after the murders at Vicksburg, a negro named
Vincent was sentenced by a Lynch club at Clinton, Miss., to
receive 300 lashes, for an alleged participation in an intended
insurrection. We copy from the <i>Clinton Gazette</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;On Wednesday evening Vincent was carried out to receive
his stripes, but the <span class="smcap">assembled multitude</span> were in favor of <i>hanging</i>
him. A vote was accordingly <i>fairly</i> taken, and the hanging
party had it by an overwhelming majority, as the politicians say.
He was remanded to <i>prison</i>. On the day of execution a <i>still
larger crowd was assembled</i>, and fearing that the public sentiment
might have changed in regard to his fate, after everything favorable
to the culprit was alleged which could be said, the vote was
taken, and his <i>death was demanded by the people</i>. In pursuance of
this sentiment, so unequivocally expressed, he was led to a black
jack and suspended to one of its branches&mdash;<span class="smcap">we approve entirely
of the proceedings; the people have acted properly</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Thus, <span class="smcap">sixteen</span> human beings were deliberately and publicly
murdered, by assembled crowds, in different parts of the State of
Mississippi, within little more than one <span class="smcap">week</span>, in open defiance of
the laws and Constitution of the State.</p>

<p class="indent">And now we ask, what notice did the chief magistrate
of Mississippi, sworn to support her Constitution, sworn to execute
her laws&mdash;what notice, we ask, did he take of these horrible
massacres? Why, at the next session of the Legislature, Governor
Lynch, addressing them in reference to abolition, remarked,
&quot;Mississippi has given a <i>practical</i> demonstration of feeling on
this exciting subject, that may serve as an impressive admonition
to offenders; and however we may regret the occasion, we are
constrained to admit, that necessity will sometimes prompt a summary
mode of trial and punishment unknown to the law.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The iniquity and utter falsehood of this declaration, as applied
to the transactions alluded to, are palpable. If the victims were
innocent, no necessity required their murder. If guilty, no necessity
required their execution contrary to law. There was no
difficulty in securing their persons, and bringing them to trial.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In 1841, an <i>unsuccessful</i> attempt was made in Kentucky to
murder a man. The assailants were arrested and lodged in jail
for trial. Their fate is thus related in a letter by an eye-witness,
published in the Cincinnati Gazette:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&quot;<i>Williamstown, Ky., July 11, 1841.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The unfortunate men, Lyman Couch and Smith Maythe, were
taken out of jail on Saturday about 12 o&#39;clock, and taken to the
ground where they committed the horrid deed on Utterback, and
at 4 o&#39;clock were <span class="smcap">hung</span> on the tree where Utterback lay when
his throat was cut. The jail was opened by force. I suppose
there were from <span class="smcap">four to seven hundred</span> people engaged in it.
Resistance was all in vain. There were three speeches made to
the mob, but all in vain. They allowed the prisoners the privilege
of clergy for about five hours, and then observed that they
had made their peace with God, and they deserved to die. The
mob was conducted with coolness and order, more so than I ever
heard of on such occasions. But such a day was never witnessed
in our little village, and I hope never will be again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The fact that this atrocity was perpetrated in &quot;our little village,&quot;
and by a rural population, affords an emphatic and horrible
indication of the state of morals in one of the oldest and best of
our slave States.</p>

<p class="indent">Would that we could here close these fearful narratives; but
another and more recent instance of that ferocious lawlessness which
slavery has engendered, must still be added. The following facts
are gathered from the Norfolk (Va.) Beacon of 19th Nov., 1842.</p>

<p class="indent">George W. Lore was, in April, 1842, convicted in Alabama,
on circumstantial evidence, of the crime of murder. The Supreme
Court granted a new trial, remarking, as is stated in another
paper, that the testimony on which he was convicted was &quot;unfit
to be received by any court of justice recognized among civilized
nations.&quot; In the mean time, Lore escaped from jail, and was
afterwards arrested. He was seized by a mob, who put it to
vote, whether he should be surrendered to the civil authority or
be <i>hung</i>. Of 132 votes, 130 were for immediate death, and he
was accordingly <span class="smcap">hung</span> at Spring Hill, Bourbon County, on the
4th November.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, fellow-citizens, what think you of Mr. Calhoun&#39;s
&quot;most safe and stable basis for free institutions?&quot; Do you
number <span class="smcap">trial by jury</span> among free institutions? You see on
what basis it rests&mdash;the will of the slaveholders. You see by
what tenure you and your children hold your lives. In New
York, you are told by high Southern authority, &quot;you may find
loafer, and loco-foco, and agrarian, and the most corrupt and
depraved of rabbles.&quot; But we ask you, where would your life
be most secure if charged with crime, amid the rabble of New
York or that of Clinton, Vicksburg, and Williamstown? We
think we have fully proved our assertion respecting the disregard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
of human life felt by the slaveholding community; and of course
their contempt for those legal barriers which are erected for its
protection. Let us now inquire more particularly how far slavery
is indeed a stable basis, on which free institutions may securely
rest.</p>

<h2>VIII. DISREGARD FOR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Governor McDuffie, in his speech of 1834 to the South Carolina
Legislature, characterized the Federal Constitution as &quot;that
miserable mockery of blurred, and obliterated, and tattered
parchment.&quot; Judging from their conduct, the slaveholders,
while fully concurring with the Governor in his contempt for the
national parchment, have quite as little respect for their own
State Constitution and Laws.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;tattered parchment&quot; of which Mr. McDuffie speaks, declares
that &quot;the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.&quot; Art.
IV. Sec. 2. Notwithstanding this express provision, there are in
almost every slave State, if not in all, laws for seizing, imprisoning,
and then selling as slaves for life, citizens having black or
yellow complexions, entering within their borders. This is done
under pretence that the individuals are supposed to be fugitives
from bondage. When circumstances forbid such a supposition,
other devices are adopted, for nullifying the provision we have
quoted. By a law of Louisiana, every free negro or mulatto,
arriving on board any vessel as a <i>mariner</i> or passenger, shall be
immediately imprisoned till the departure of the vessel, when he
is to be compelled to depart in her. If such free negro or mulatto
returns to the State, he is to be imprisoned for <span class="smcap">five</span> years.</p>

<p class="indent">The jailor of Savannah some time since reported <span class="smcap">ten stewards</span>
as being in his custody. These were free citizens of other States,
deprived of their liberty solely on account of the complexion
their Maker had given them, and in direct violation of the express
language of the Federal Constitution. If any free negro or
mulatto enters the State of Mississippi, for any cause however
urgent, any white citizen may cause him to be punished by the
Sheriff with thirty-nine lashes, and if he does not immediately
thereafter leave the State, he is <span class="smcap">sold as a slave</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">In Maryland, a free negro or mulatto, coming into the State, is
fined $20, and if he returns he is fined $500, and on default of
payment, is sold <span class="smcap">as a slave</span>. Truly indeed have the slaveholders
rendered the Constitution a blurred, obliterated, and tattered
parchment. But whenever this same Constitution can, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
grossest perversion, be made instrumental in upholding and perpetuating
human bondage, then it acquires, for the time, a marvellous
sanctity in their eyes, and they are seized with a holy
indignation at the very suspicion of its profanation.</p>

<p class="indent">The readiness with which Southern Governors prefer the most
false and audacious claims, under color of Constitutional authority,
exhibits a state of society in which truth and honor are but
little respected.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1833, seventeen slaves effected their escape from Virginia
in a boat, and finally reached New York. To recover their slaves
<i>as such</i>, a judicial investigation in New York would be necessary,
and the various claimants would be required to prove their property.
A more convenient mode presented itself. The Governor
of Virginia made a requisition on the Executive of New York for
them as fugitive <i>felons</i>, and on this requisition, a warrant was issued
for their arrest and surrender. The pretended felony was
stealing the <i>boat</i> in which they had escaped.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1839, a slave escaped from Virginia on board of a vessel
bound to New York. It was <i>suspected</i>, but without a particle of
proof, that some of the crew had favored his escape; and immediately
the master made oath that <i>three</i> of the sailors, naming
them, had feloniously <span class="smcap">stolen</span> the slave; and the Governor, well
knowing there was no slave-market in New York, and that no
man could there be held in slavery, had the hardihood to demand
the surrender of the mariners, on the charge of grand larceny;
and, in his correspondence with the Governor of New
York, declared the slave was worth six or seven hundred dollars,
and remarked that <i>stealing</i> was &quot;recognized as a <span class="smcap">crime</span> by all
laws, human and divine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In 1841, a female slave, belonging to a man named Flournoy,
in Georgia, was discovered on board a vessel about to sail for
New York, and was recovered by her master. It was afterwards
supposed, from the woman&#39;s story, that she had been induced by
one of the passengers to attempt her escape. Whereupon Flournoy
made oath that John Greenman did feloniously <span class="smcap">steal</span> his
slave. But the Governor of New York had already refused to
surrender citizens of his State, on a charge so palpably false and
absurd. It was therefore deemed necessary to trump up a very
different charge against the accused; and hence Flournoy made
a second affidavit, that John Greenman did <i>feloniously steal and
take away three blankets, two shawls, three frocks, one pair of earrings,
and two finger-rings, the property of deponent</i>. Armed with
these affidavits, the Governor demanded the surrender of Greenman
under the Constitution. Not an intimation was given by His
Excellency, when he made the demand, of the <i>real facts</i> of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
case, which, in a subsequent correspondence, he was compelled
to admit. It turned out that the woman, instead of being stolen,
went voluntarily, and no doubt joyfully, on board the vessel; and
that the wearing apparel, &amp;c., were the clothes and ornaments
worn by her; nor was there a pretence that Greenman had ever
touched them, or ever had them in his possession.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1838, Rev. John B. Mahan, a Methodist preacher, residing
in Ohio, was reported to have given aid and shelter to fugitive
slaves from Kentucky, and forthwith the Grand Jury of Mason
County, in that State, indicted him, as being &quot;late of the County
of Mason,&quot; for aiding two slaves in making their escape from said
county. On the strength of this indictment, Governor Clark, of
Kentucky, issued his requisition on the Governor of Ohio, wherein
he stated that the said Mahan &quot;<i>has fled from justice, and is now
going at large in the State of Ohio</i>;&quot; and that by virtue of the authority
vested in him by the &quot;Constitution and Laws of the
United States, he did demand the said John B. Mahan, as <i>a fugitive
from the justice of the laws of this State</i>.&quot; On this requisition
Mahan was seized, carried into Kentucky, put in irons, and kept
in prison as a felon for about ten weeks, when, after a trial which
lasted six days, he was acquitted by the jury. Now it was a
matter of notoriety, and <i>admitted</i> by the prosecution, that Mahan
had not been in Kentucky for about <i>twenty years</i>!! Yet day
after day was spent in endeavors to procure the conviction of a
man who had committed no offence against the laws of the State,
and whose person had been seized in consequence of a gross
fraud, and a palpable and acknowledged falsehood. But how
happened it that the slaveholders permitted their prey to escape?
Fortunately for Mahan, the Governor of Ohio, after surrendering
him, discovered the imposition that had been practised, and officially
informed the Governor of Kentucky, that he could not consent
that a citizen of Ohio should be taken to another State, and
tried for an offence not committed within her jurisdiction. The
publication of this letter drew the attention of the community to
the infamous outrage that had been practised. If, after this,
Mahan had been Lynched, or even judicially punished, a controversy
would have arisen between the two States, which would
necessarily have given new strength and influence to the anti-slavery
cause.</p>

<p class="indent">But perhaps the most insolent attempt yet made to pervert the
Federal Constitution to the support of slavery, was the expedient
devised in Alabama to muzzle the Northern press. An article
appeared in a newspaper published in New York, in 1835, which
gave offence to certain planters in that State; and forthwith a
grand jury, <i>on their oaths</i>, indicted the New York publisher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;late of the County of Tuscaloosa,&quot; for endeavoring to excite
insurrection among the slaves, by circulating a seditious paper;
and on this indictment the Governor had the impudence to make
a formal requisition for the surrender of the publisher, as a <i>fugitive
from justice</i>, although he had never breathed the air of
Alabama.</p>

<p class="indent">We have said that the slaveholders hold their <i>own</i> laws and
Constitutions in the same contempt as those of the Federal Government,
whenever they conflict with the security and permanency
of slavery. One of the most inestimable of constitutional
privileges is <span class="smcap">trial by jury</span>; and this, as we have seen, is trampled
under foot with impunity, at the mandate of the slaveholders.
Even <span class="smcap">John Tyler</span>, as it appears, is for inflicting
summary punishment on abolitionists, by a Lynch club, &quot;without
resorting to any other tribunal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We now proceed to inquire how far they respect the liberty of
speech and of the press.</p>

<h2>IX. LIBERTY OF SPEECH.</h2>

<p class="indent">The whole nation witnessed the late successful efforts of the
slaveholders in Congress, by their various gag resolutions, and
through the aid of recreant Northern politicians, to destroy all
freedom of debate adverse to &quot;the peculiar institution.&quot; They
were themselves ready to dwell, in debate, on the charms of human
bondage; but when a member took the other side of the question,
then, indeed, he was out of order, the constitution was outraged, and
the Union endangered. We all know the violent threats which
have been used, to intimidate the friends of human rights from
expressing their sentiments in the national legislature. &quot;As
long,&quot; says Governor McDuffie to the South Carolina Legislature,
&quot;as long as the halls of Congress shall be <i>open</i> to the <i>discussion</i>
of this question, we can have neither peace nor security.&quot; The
Charleston Mercury is, on this subject, very high authority; and
in 1837 its editor announced that &quot;Public opinion in the South
would now, we are sure, justify an <i>immediate resort to</i> <span class="smcap">force</span> <i>by
the Southern delegation, even on the</i> <span class="smcap">floor of Congress</span>, were
they forthwith to <span class="smcap">seize and drag from the hall</span> any man who
dared to insult them, as that eccentric old showman, John Quincy
Adams has dared to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When so much malignity is manifested against the freedom of
speech, in the very sanctuary of American liberty, it is not to be
supposed that it will be tolerated in the house of bondage. We
have already quoted a Southern paper, which declares that the
moment &quot;any private individual attempts to lecture us on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
evils and immorality of slavery, that very moment his tongue
shall be cut out and cast upon the dunghill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In Marion College, Missouri, there appeared some symptoms
of anti-slavery feeling among the students. A Lynch club assembled,
and the Rev. Dr. Ely, one of the professors, appeared
before them, and denounced abolition, and submitted a series of
resolutions passed by the faculty, and among them the following:
&quot;We do hereby forbid all discussions and public meetings among
the students upon the subject of domestic slavery.&quot; The Lynchers
were pacified, and neither tore down the college nor hung up
the professors; but before separating they resolved that they would
oppose the elevation to office of any man entertaining abolition
sentiments, and would withhold their countenance and support
from every such member of the community. Indeed, it is obvious
to any person attentive to the movements of the South, that the
slaveholders dread <i>domestic</i> far more than foreign interference
with their darling system. They dread <i>you</i>, fellow-citizens, and
they dread converts among themselves.</p>

<h2>X. LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Constitutions of all the slave States guarantee, in the most
solemn and explicit terms, the Liberty of the Press; but it is
well understood that there is one exception to its otherwise unbounded
license&mdash;Property in human flesh is too sacred to be assailed
by the press. The attributes of the Deity may be discussed,
but not the rights of the master. The characters of
public, and even of private men, may be vilified at pleasure,
provided no reproach is flung upon the <i>slaveholder</i>. Every
abuse in Church or State may be ferreted out and exposed, except
the cruelties practiced upon the slaves, unless when they
happen to exceed the ordinary standard of cruelty established
by general usage. Every measure of policy may be advocated,
except that of free labor; every question of right may be examined,
except that of a man to himself; every dogma in theology
may be propagated, except that of the sinfulness of the
slave code. The very instant the press ventures beyond its prescribed
limits, the constitutional barriers erected for its protection
sink into the dust, and a censorship, the more stern and vindictive
from being illegal, crushes it into submission. The midnight
burglary perpetrated upon the Charleston Post-office, and the
conflagration of the anti-slavery papers found in it, are well
known. These papers had been sent to distinguished citizens,
but it was deemed inexpedient to <i>permit</i> them to read facts and
arguments against slavery. Pains will be taken to prevent <i>you</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
from reading this address, and vast pains have been taken to keep
slaveholders as well as others ignorant of every fact and argument
that militates against the system. Hence Mr. Calhoun&#39;s
famous bill, authorizing every Southern post-master to abstract
from the mails every paper relating to slavery. Hence the insane
efforts constantly made to expurgate the literature of the world
of all recognition of the rights of <i>black</i> men. Novels, annuals,
poems, and histories, containing sentiments hostile to human
bondage, are proscribed at the South, and Northern publishers
have had the extreme baseness to publish mutilated editions for
the Southern market.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_11_11">
<span class="label">[11]</span></a>
The Harpers, of New York, in reply to a letter from the South, complaining
of the anti-slavery sentiments in a book they had recently published,
stated, &quot;since the receipt of your letter we have published an
edition of the &#39;Woods and Fields,&#39; <i>in which the offensive matter has been
omitted</i>.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In some of the slave States laws have been passed establishing
a censorship of the press, for the exclusive and special benefit of
the slaveholders. Some time since an anti-slavery pamphlet was
mailed at New York, directed to a gentleman in Virginia. Presently
a letter was received from William Wilson, post-master at
Lexington, Va., saying&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;I have to advise you that a law passed at the last session of
the Legislature of this State, which took effect on the first day
of this month, makes it the duty of the post-masters or their
assistants to report to some magistrate (under penalty of from
$50 to $200), the receipt of all <i>such</i> publications at his office;
and if, on examination, the magistrate is of opinion they come
under the provision of the law, it is his duty to have them <span class="smcap">burnt</span>
in his presence&mdash;<i>which operation was performed on the above mentioned
pamphlet this morning</i>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The Rev. Robert J. Breckenridge, a well-known zealous opponent
of abolition, edited, in 1835, &quot;The Baltimore Religious
Magazine.&quot; A number of this magazine contained an article
from a correspondent, entitled &quot;Bible-Slavery.&quot; The tone of
this article not suiting the slave-breeders of Petersburg (Virg.),
the subscribers were deprived of the numbers forwarded to them
through the post-office of that town. The magazines were taken
from the Office, and on the 8th May, 1838, were burnt in the
street, before the door of the public reading-room, in the <i>presence
and by the direction of the Mayor and Recorder</i>!!</p>

<p class="indent">It is surely unnecessary to remark, that this Virginia law is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
contemptuous violation of the Constitution of Virginia, and of the
authority of the Federal Government. The act of Congress
requires each post-master to deliver the papers which come to his
office to the persons to whom they are directed, and they require
him to take an oath to fulfil his duty. The Virginia law imposes
duties on an officer over whom they have no control, utterly at
variance with his oath, and the obligations under which he assumed
the office. If the postmaster must select, under a heavy
penalty, for a public bonfire, all papers bearing on slavery, why
may he not be hereafter required to select, for the same fate, all
papers hostile to Popery? Yet similar laws are now in force in
various slave States.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only is this espionage exercised over the mail, but measures
are taken to keep the community in ignorance of what is
passing abroad in relation to slavery, and what opinions are elsewhere
held respecting it.</p>

<p class="indent">On the 1st of August, 1842, an interesting address was delivered
in Massachusetts, by the late Dr. Channing, in relation to
West India emancipation, embracing, as was natural and proper,
reflections on American slavery. This address was copied into a
New York weekly paper, and the number containing it was offered
for sale, as usual, by the agent of the periodical at Charleston.
Instantly the agent was prosecuted by the South Carolina
Association, and was held to bail in the sum of $1,000, to answer
for his <span class="smcap">crime</span>. Presently after, this same agent received for sale
a supply of &quot;Dickens&#39; Notes on the United States,&quot; but having
before his eyes the fear of the slaveholders, he gave notice in the
newspapers, that the book would &quot;be submitted to highly intelligent
members of the South Carolina Association for <i>inspection</i>,
and IF the sale is approved by them, it will be for sale&mdash;if not,
not.&quot; And so the population of one of the largest cities of the
slave region were not permitted to read a book they were all
burning with impatience to see, till the volume had been first <i>inspected</i>
by a self-constituted board of censors! The slaveholders,
however, were in this instance afraid to put their power to the
test&mdash;the people might have rebelled if forbidden to read the
&quot;Notes,&quot; and hence one of the most powerful, effective anti-slavery
tracts yet issued from the press was permitted to be circulated,
because people <i>would</i> read what Dickens had written.
Surely, fellow-citizens, you will not accuse us of slander, when
we say that the slaveholders have abolished among you the
liberty of the press. Remember the assertion of the editor of the
Missouri Argus: &quot;Abolition editors in the slave States will not
dare to avow their opinions: it would be <span class="smcap">instant death</span> to
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span></p>

<h2>XI. MILITARY WEAKNESS.</h2>

<p class="indent">A distinguished foreigner, after travelling in the Southern
States, remarked that the very aspect of the country bore testimony
to the temerity of the nullifiers, who, defenceless and exposed
as they are, could not dare to hazard a civil war; and
surely no people in the world have more cause to shrink from an
appeal to arms. We find at the South no one element of military
strength. Slavery, as we have seen, checks the progress of population,
of the arts, of enterprise, and of industry. But above
all, the laboring class, which in other countries affords the materials
of which armies are composed, is regarded among you as
your most deadly foe; and the sight of a thousand negroes with
arms in their hands, would send a thrill of terror through the
stoutest hearts, and excite a panic which no number of the veteran
troops of Europe could produce. Even now, laws are in
force to keep arms out of the hands of a population which ought
to be your reliance in danger, but which is your dread by day
and night, in peace and war.</p>

<p class="indent">During our revolutionary war, when the idea of negro emancipation
had scarcely entered the imagination of any of our citizens&mdash;when
there were no &quot;fanatic abolitionists,&quot; no &quot;incendiary
publications,&quot; no &quot;treasonable&quot; anti-slavery associations; in
those palmy days of slavery, no small portion of the Southern
militia were withdrawn from the defence of the country to protect
the slaveholders from the vengeance of their own bondmen!
This you would be assured was abolition slander, were not the
fact recorded in the national archives. <i>The Secret Journal of
Congress</i> (Vol. I., p. 105) contains the following remarkable and
instructive record:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<i>March 29th, 1779.</i>&mdash;The Committee appointed to take into
consideration the <i>circumstances of the Southern States</i>, and the
ways and means for <i>their</i> safety and defence, report, That the
State of South Carolina (as represented by the delegates of the
said State, and by Mr. Huger, who has come hither at the request
of the Governor of said State, on purpose to explain the
particular circumstances thereof,) is <span class="smcap">unable</span> to make any effectual
efforts with militia, by reason of the great proportion of citizens
<i>necessary to remain at home, to prevent insurrection among the
negroes</i>, and to prevent the desertion of them to the enemy.
That the state of the country, and the great number of these
people among them, expose the inhabitants to <i>great danger</i>, from
the endeavors of the enemy to excite them to revolt or desert.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">At the first census, in 1790, eleven years after this report, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
when the slaves had unquestionably greatly increased their numbers,
they were only 107,094 <i>fewer</i> than the whites. If, then,
these slaves exposed their masters &quot;to great danger,&quot; and the
militia of South Carolina were obliged to <i>stay at home</i> to protect
their families, not from the foreign invaders, but the domestic
enemies, what would be the condition of the little blustering nullifying
State, with a foreign army on her shores, and 335,000
slaves ready to aid it, while her own white population, <i>militia</i>
and all, is but as two whites to three blacks?</p>

<p class="indent">You well know that slaveholders, in answer to the abolitionists,
are wont to boast of the fidelity and attachment of their slaves;
and you also well know, that among themselves they freely avow
their dread of these same faithful and attached slaves, and are
fertile in expedients to guard against their vengeance.</p>

<p class="indent">It is natural that we should fear those whom we are conscious
of having deeply injured, and all history and experience testify
that fear is a cruel passion. Hence the shocking severity with
which, in all slave countries, attempts to shake off an unrighteous
yoke are punished. So late even as 1822, certain slaves in
Charleston were <i>suspected</i> of an <i>intention</i> to rise and assert their
freedom. No overt act was committed, but certain blacks were
found who professed to testify against their fellows, and some, it
is said, confessed their intentions.</p>

<p class="indent">On this ensued one of the most horrible judicial butcheries on
record. It is not deemed necessary, in the chivalrous Palmetto
State, to give grand and petit juries the trouble of indicting and
trying slaves, even when their lives are at stake. A court, consisting
of two Justices of the Peace and five freeholders, was convened
for the trial of the accused, and the following were the
results of their labors:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, let it be remembered, that this sacrifice of human life
was made by one of the lowest tribunals in the State; a tribunal
consisting of two petty magistrates and five freeholders, appointed
for the occasion, not possessing a judicial rank, nor professing to
be learned in the law; in short, a tribunal which would not be
trusted to decide the title to an acre of ground&mdash;we refer not to
the individuals composing the court, but to the court itself;&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
court which has not power to take away the land of a white man,
hangs black men by dozens!</p>

<p class="indent">Listen to the confessions of the slaveholders with regard to
their happy dependents; the men who are so contented under
the patriarchal system, and whose condition might well excite
the envy of northern laborers, &quot;the great democratic rabble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Governor Hayne, in his message of 1833, warned the South
Carolina Legislature, that &quot;a state of <i>military preparation</i> must
always be with us a state of perfect <i>domestic</i> security. A profound
peace, and consequent apathy, may expose us to the danger
of <i>domestic insurrection</i>.&quot; So it seems the happy slaves are
to be kept from insurrection by a state of military preparation.
We have seen that, during the revolutionary <i>war</i>, the Carolina
militia were kept at home watching the slaves, instead of meeting
the British in the field; but now it seems the same task awaits
the militia in a season of profound peace. Another South Carolinian<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
admonishes his countrymen thus: &quot;Let it never be forgotten
that our negroes are truly the Jacobins of the country;
that they are the anarchists, and the domestic enemy, <span class="smcap">the common
enemy of civilized society, and the barbarians who
would, if they could, become the destroyers of our race</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again, &quot;Hatred to the whites, with the exception, in some

life-blood</span> whenever the opportunity is offered; in the mean
time intent on doing us all the mischief in his power.&quot;&mdash;<i>Southern
Religious Telegraph.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In a debate in the Kentucky Legislature, in 1841, Mr. Harding,
opposing the repeal of the law prohibiting the importation of
slaves from other States, and looking forward to the time when
the blacks would greatly out-number the whites, exclaimed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;In such a state of things, suppose an insurrection of the slaves
to take place. The master has become timid and fearful, the
slave bold and daring&mdash;the white men, overpowered with a sense
of superior numbers on the part of the slaves, cannot be embodied
together; <i>every man must guard his own hearth and fireside</i>.
No man would even dare for an hour to leave his own habitation;
if he did, he would expect on his return to find his wife and
children massacred. But the slaves, with but little more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
the shadow of opposition before them, armed with the consciousness
of superior force and superior numbers on their side, animated
with the hope of liberty, and maddened with the spirit of
revenge, embody themselves in every neighborhood, and furiously
march over the country, visiting every neighborhood with all the
horrors of civil war and bloodshed. And thus the yoke would
be transferred from the black to the white man, and the master
fall a bleeding victim to his own slave.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Such are the terrific visions which are constantly presenting
themselves to the affrighted imaginations of the slaveholders;
such the character which, <i>among themselves</i>, they attribute to
their own domestics.</p>

<p class="indent">Attend to one more, and that one an extraordinary confession:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;We, of the South, are emphatically surrounded by a dangerous
class of beings&mdash;degraded and stupid savages, who, if they
could but once entertain the idea, that immediate and unconditional
death would not be their portion, would re-act the St. Domingo
tragedy. But a consciousness, with all their stupidity, that
a ten-fold force, superior in discipline, <i>if not in barbarity</i>, would
gather from the <i>four corners of the United States</i>, and slaughter
them, keeps them in subjection. But to the <i>non-slaveholding
States</i> particularly, are we indebted for a permanent safeguard
against insurrection. Without their assistance, the white population
of the South would be <i>too weak</i> to quiet the innate desire for
liberty, which is ever ready to act itself out with every rational
creature.&quot;&mdash;<i>Maysville Intelligencer.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And now we ask you, fellow-citizens, if all these declarations
and confessions be true&mdash;and who can doubt it&mdash;what must be
your inevitable condition, should your soil be invaded by a foreign
foe, bearing the standard of <span class="smcap">emancipation</span>?</p>

<p class="indent">In perfect accordance with the above confession, that to the
non-slaveholding States the South is indebted for a permanent
safeguard against insurrection, Mr. Underwood, of Kentucky,
uttered these pregnant words in a debate, in 1842, in Congress,
&quot;<span class="smcap">The dissolution of the Union will be the dissolution of
slavery</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The action of the Federal Government is, we know, controlled
by the slave interest; and what testimony does that action bear
to the military weakness of the South? Let the reports of its
high functionaries answer.</p>

<p class="indent">The Secretary of War, in his report for 1842, remarked, &quot;The
works intended for the more remote Southern portion of our territory,
particularly require attention. Indications are already made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
designs of the worst character against that region, in the event of
hostilities from a <i>certain quarter</i>, to which we cannot be insensible.&quot;
The Secretary&#39;s fears had been evidently excited by the
organization of <i>black</i> regiments in the British West Indies, and
the threats of certain English writers, that a war between the
two countries would result in the liberation of the slaves. The
report from the Quarter-Master, General Jessup, a Southern man,
betrays the same anxiety, and in less ambiguous terms: &quot;In the
event of a war,&quot; says he, &quot;with either of the great European
powers possessing colonies in the West Indies, there will be danger
of the peninsula of Florida being occupied by BLACKS from
the Islands. A proper regard for the security of our <i>Southern
States</i> requires, that prompt and efficient measures be adopted to
prevent such a state of things.&quot; The Secretary of the Navy, a
slaveholder, <i>hints</i> his fears in cautious circumlocution. Speaking
of the event of a war with any considerable maritime power, he
says, &quot;It would be a war of incursions aimed at <i>revolution</i>. The
first blow would be struck at us through our <i>institutions</i>;&quot; he
means, of course, &quot;the peculiar institution.&quot; He then proceeds
to show that the enemy would seek success &quot;in arraying, what
are supposed to be, the hostile elements of our <i>social system</i>
against each other;&quot; and he admits, that &quot;even in the best event,
war on our own soil would be the more expensive, the more embarrassing,
and the more <span class="smcap">horrible</span> in its effects, by compelling us
at the same time to oppose an enemy in the field, and <i>to guard</i>
against all attempts to <i>subvert our social system</i>.&quot; In plain language,
an invading enemy would strike the first blow at the slave
system, and thus aim at revolution,&mdash;a revolution that would give
liberty to two and a half millions of human beings; and that such
a war would be very embarrassing to the slaveholders, and the
more horrible, because, as formerly in South Carolina, a large
share of their military force would necessarily be employed, not
in fighting the enemy, but in guarding the <span class="smcap">social</span>, that is, the
&quot;patriarchal system.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No persons are more sensible of their hazardous situation than
the slaveholders themselves, and hence, as is common with
people who are secretly conscious of their own weakness, they
attempt to supply the want of strength by a bullying insolence,
hoping to effect by intimidation what they well know can be effected
in no other way. This game has long been played, and
with great success, in Congress. It has been attempted in our
negotiations with Great Britain, and has signally failed.</p>

<p class="indent">Your aristocracy, whatever may be their vaunts, are conscious
of their military weakness, and shrink from any contest which
may cause a foreign army to plant the standard of emancipation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
upon their soil. The very idea of an armed negro startles their
fearful imaginations. This is disclosed on innumerable occasions,
but was conspicuously manifested in a debate in the Senate. In
July, 1842, a Bill to regulate enlistments in the naval service being
under consideration, Mr. <span class="smcap">Calhoun</span> proposed an amendment,
that negroes should be enlisted only as <i>cooks</i> and <i>stewards</i>. He
thought it a matter of <i>great consequence</i> not to admit blacks into
our vessels of national defence. Mr. <span class="smcap">Benton</span> thought <i>all arms</i>,
whether on land or sea, ought to be borne by the white race.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. <span class="smcap">Bagby</span>. &quot;In the Southern portion of the Union, the great
object was to <i>keep arms and a knowledge of arms</i> out of the hands
of the blacks. The subject addressed itself to every Southern
heart. Self-preservation was the first law of nature, and the
South must look to that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the motion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Preston</span>, the bill was so amended as to
include the army.</p>

<p class="indent">And think you that men, thus in awe of their own dependents,
shuddering at a musket in the hands of a black, and with a population
of two millions and a half of these dreaded slaves, will
expose themselves to the tremendous consequences of a union
between their domestic and foreign enemies? Of the four who
voted against the British treaty, probably not one would have
given the vote he did, had he not known to a certainty that the
treaty would be ratified.</p>

<p class="indent">Think not we are disposed to ridicule the fears of the slaveholders,
or to question their personal courage. God knows their
perils are real, and not imaginary: and who can question, that
with a hostile <i>British</i> army in the heart of Virginia or Alabama,
the whole slave region would presently become one vast scene of
horror and desolation? Heretofore the invaders of our soil were
themselves interested in slave property: <i>now</i> they would be zealous
emancipationists, and they would be accompanied by the
most terrific vision which could meet the eye of a slaveholder,
regiments of <i>black troops</i>, fully equipped and disciplined. Surely
such a state of things might well appal the bravest heart, and
palsy the stoutest arm. But, fellow-citizens, what, in such a
catastrophe, would be your condition? Your fate and that of
your wives and children would then be linked to that of your
lordly neighbors. One indiscriminate ruin would await you all.
But <i>you</i> may avert these accumulated horrors. You may change
two and a half millions of domestic and implacable enemies into
faithful friends and generous protectors. No sooner shall the
negroes cease to be oppressed, than they will cease to hate. The
planters of Jamaica were formerly as much afraid of their slaves,
as your planters now are of theirs. But the Jamaica slaves, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
freemen, are no long dreaded; on the contrary, they form the
chief military force of the island; and should a foreign foe
attack it, would be found its willing and devoted defenders.
It rests with <i>you</i> to relieve your country of its most dangerous
enemy, to render it invulnerable to foreign assaults, and to dissipate
that fearful anticipation of wrath and tribulation, which now
broods over and oppresses the mind of every white who resides
in a slave country.</p>

<p class="indent">We have called your attention to the practical influence of
slavery on various points deeply affecting your prosperity and
happiness. These are:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"> 1. Increase of population.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 2. State of education.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 3. Industry and enterprise.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 4. Feeling toward the laboring classes.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 5. State of religion.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 6. State of morals.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 7. Disregard for human life.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 8. Disregard for constitutional obligations.</span><br />
<span class="i0"> 9. Liberty of speech.</span><br />
<span class="i0">10. Liberty of the press.</span><br />
<span class="i0">11. Military weakness.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">You will surely agree with us, that in many of these particulars,
the States to which you belong are sunk far below the ordinary
condition of civilized nations. The slaveholders, in their
listlessness and idleness, in their contempt for the laws, in their
submission to illegal and ferocious violence, in their voluntary surrender
of their constitutional rights, and above all in their disregard
for human life, and their cruelty in taking it, are, as a civilized
and professedly a Christian community, without a parallel,
unless possibly among some of the anarchical States of South
America.</p>

<p class="indent">When compelled to acknowledge the superior prosperity of the
free States, the slaveholders are fond of imputing the difference
to tariffs, or to government patronage, or to any other than the
true cause.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us then inquire, whether the inferior and unhappy condition
of the slave States can indeed be ascribed to any natural
disadvantage under which they are laboring, or to any partial or
unjust legislation by the Federal Government?</p>

<p class="indent">In the first place, the slave States cannot pretend that they have
not received their full share of the national domain, and that the
narrowness of their territorial limits have retarded the development
of their enterprise and resources. The area of the slave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
States is nearly <i>double</i> that of the free. New York has acquired
the title of the <i>Empire</i> State; yet she is inferior in size to Virginia,
Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana, or North Carolina.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor can it be maintained that the free States are in advance
of the slave States, because from an earlier settlement they had
the start in the race of improvement. Virginia is not only the
largest, but the <i>oldest</i> settled State in the confederacy. She,
together with Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina and South
Carolina, were all settled before Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor will any slaveholder admit, for a moment, that Providence
has scattered his gifts with a more sparing hand at the South
than at the North. The richness of their soil, the salubrity of
their climate, the number and magnitude of their rivers, are
themes on which they delight to dwell; and not unfrequent is
the contrast they draw between their own fair and sunny land,
and the ungenial climate and sterile soil of the Northern and
Eastern States. Hence the moral difference between the two
sections of our republic must arise from other than natural causes.
It appears also that this difference is becoming wider and wider.
Of this fact we could give various proofs; but let one suffice.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it appears that in 1790 the free population of the South
was 72 per cent. of that of the North, and that in 1840 it was only
49 per cent.; while the difference in 1840 is more than <i>nine</i> times
as great as it was in 1790.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus you perceive how unequal is the race in which you are
contending. Fifty years have given the North an increased preponderance
of about four and a half millions of free citizens.
Another fifty years will increase this preponderance in a vastly
augmented ratio. And now we ask you, why this downward
course? Why this continually increasing disparity between you and
your Northern brethren? Is it because the interests of the slaveholders
are not represented in the national councils? Let us see.
We have already shown you that your <i>free</i> population is only 49
per cent. of that of the Northern States; that is, the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
of the free States are more than <i>double</i> the free inhabitants of
the slave States. Now, what is the proportion of members of
Congress from the two sections?</p>

<p class="indent">In the Senate, the slave States have precisely as many as the
free; and in the lower House, their members are 65 per cent. of
those from the free States.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_13_13">
<span class="label">[13]</span></a>
135 from the free and 88 members from the slave States. According
to <i>free</i> population, the South would have only 66 members.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Senate has a veto on every law; and as one half of that
body are slaveholders, it follows, of course, that no law can be
passed without their consent. Nor has any bill passed the Senate,
since the organization of the government, but by the votes of
slaveholders. It is idle, therefore, for them to impute their depressed
condition to unjust and partial legislation, since they have
from the very first controlled the action of Congress. Not a law
has been passed, not a treaty ratified, but by their votes.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is this all. Appointments under the federal government
are made by the President, with the consent of the Senate, and
of course the slaveholders have, and always have had, a veto on
every appointment. There is not an officer of the federal government
to whose appointment slaveholding members of the
Senate have not consented. Yet all this gives but an inadequate
idea of the political influence exercised by the <i>people</i> of the slave
States in the election of President, and consequently over the policy
of his administration. In consequence of the peculiar apportionment
of Presidential Electors among the States, and the operation
of the rule of <i>federal numbers</i>&mdash;whereby, for the purpose of
estimating the representative population, five slaves are counted
as three white men&mdash;most extraordinary results are exhibited at
every election of President. In the election of 1848, the Electors
chosen were 290: of these 169 were from the free, and 121
from the slave States.</p>

<p class="indent">These facts address themselves to the understanding of all,
and prove, beyond cavil, that the slave States have a most unfair
and unreasonable representation in Congress, and a very disproportionate
share in the election of President.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor can these States complain that they are stinted in the
distribution of the <i>patronage</i> of the national government. The
rule of <i>federal numbers</i>, confined by the Constitution to the
apportionment of representatives, has been extended, by the influence
of the slaveholders, to other and very different subjects.
Thus, the distribution among the States of the surplus revenue,
and of the proceeds of the public lands, was made according to
this same iniquitous rule.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not to be supposed that the slaveholders have failed to
avail themselves of their influence in the federal government. A
very brief statement will convince you, that if they are now feeble
and emaciated, it is not because they have been deprived of their
share of the loaves and fishes.</p>

<p class="indent">By law, midshipmen and cadets, at West Point, are appointed
according to the Federal ratio; thus have the slaveholders secured
to themselves an additional number of officers in the Army and
Navy, on account of their slaves.</p>

<p class="indent">Reflect for a moment on the vast patronage wielded by the
President of the United States, and then recollect, that should
the present incumbent (General Taylor) serve his full term, the
office will have been filled no less than <i>fifty-two</i> years out of
sixty-four by slaveholders!<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>

no less than 13 were assigned to slaveholders!</p>

<p class="indent">Surely, surely, if the South be wanting in every element of
prosperity&mdash;if ignorance, barbarity and poverty be her characteristics,
it is not because she has not exercised her due influence in
the general government, or received her share of its honors and
emoluments.</p>

<h2>PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.</h2>

<p class="indent">If, fellow-citizens, with all the natural and political advantages
we have enumerated, your progress is still downward, and has
been so, compared with the other sections of the country, since
the first organization of the Government, what are the anticipations
of the distant future, which sober reflection authorizes you
to form? The causes which now retard the increase of your
population must continue to operate, so long as slavery lasts.
Emigrants from the North, and from foreign countries, will, as at
present, avoid your borders, within which no attractions will be
found for virtue and industry. On the other hand, many of the
young and enterprising among you will flee from the lassitude,
the anarchy, the wretchedness engendered by slavery, and seek
their fortunes in lands where law affords protection, and where
labor is honored and rewarded.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime, especially in the cotton States, the slaves
will continue to increase in a ratio far beyond the whites, and will
at length acquire a fearful preponderance.</p>

<p class="indent">At the first census, in every slave State there was a very large
majority of whites&mdash;now, the slaves out-number the whites in
South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana, and the next census
will unquestionably add Florida and Alabama, and probably
Georgia, to the number of negro States.</p>

<p class="indent">And think you that this is the country, and this the age, in
which the republican maxim that the <span class="smcap">majority</span> must govern, can
be long and barbarously reversed? Think you that the majority
of the <span class="smcap">People</span> in the cotton States, cheered and encouraged as
they will be by the sympathy of the world, and the example of
the West Indies, will forever tamely submit to be beasts of burden
for a few lordly planters? And remember, we pray you,
that the number and physical strength of the negroes will increase
in a much greater ratio than that of their masters.</p>

<p class="indent">Maryland and Virginia, the great breeding States, have reduced
their stock within the last few years, having been tempted,
by high prices, to ship off thousands and tens of thousands to the
markets of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. But these
markets are already glutted, and human flesh has fallen in value
from 50 to 75 per cent. Nor is it probable that the great staple
of Virginia and Maryland will hereafter afford a bounty on its
production. In these States slave labor is unprofitable, and the
bondman is of but little value, save as an article of exportation.
The cotton cultivation in the East Indies, by cheapening the article,
will close the markets in the South, and thus it guarantees
the abolition of slavery in the breeding States. When it shall be
found no longer profitable to raise slaves for the market, the
stock on hand will be driven South and sold for what it may
fetch, and free labor substituted in its place. This process will
be attended with results disastrous to the cotton States. To
Virginia and Maryland, it will open a new era of industry, prosperity
and wealth; and the industrious poor, the &quot;mean whites&quot;
of the South, will remove within their borders, thus leaving the
slaveholders more defenceless than ever. But while the white
population of the South will be thus diminished, its number of
slaves will be increased by the addition of the stock from the
breeding States.</p>

<p class="indent">And what, fellow-citizens, will be the condition of such of <i>you</i>
as shall then remain in the slave States? The change to which we
have referred will necessarily aggravate every present evil. Ignorance,
vice, idleness, lawless violence, dread of insurrection, anarchy,
and a haughty and vindictive aristocracy will all combine with
augmented energy in crushing <i>you</i> to the earth. And from what
quarter do you look for redemption? Think you your planting
nobility will ever grant freedom to their serfs, from sentiments of
piety or patriotism? Remember that your clergy of all sects and
ranks, many of them &quot;Christian brokers in the trade of blood,&quot;
unite in bestowing their benediction on the system as a <i>Christian</i>
institution, and in teaching the slaveholders that they wield the
whip as European monarchs the sceptre, &quot;by the grace of God.&quot;
Do you trust to their patriotism? Remember that the beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
and affecting contrast between the prosperity of the North and
the desolation of the South, already presented to you, was drawn
by W. G. Preston, of <i>hanging</i> notoriety. No, fellow-citizens,
your great slaveholders have no idea of surrendering the personal
importance and the political influence they derive from their
slaves. Your Calhouns, Footes, and Prestons, all go for everlasting
slavery.</p>

<p class="indent">Unquestionably there are many of the smaller slaveholders who
would embrace abolition sentiments, were they permitted to examine
the subject; but at present they are kept in ignorance.
If then the fetters of the slave are not to be broken by the
master, by whom is he to be liberated? In the course of time, a
hostile army, invited by the weakness or the arrogance of the
South, may land on your shores. Then, indeed, emancipation will
be given, but the gift may be bathed in the blood of yourselves
and of your children. Or the People&mdash;for they will be <span class="smcap">the People</span>&mdash;may
resolve to be free, and you and all you hold dear may
be sacrificed in the contest.</p>

<p class="indent">Suffer us, fellow-citizens, to show you &quot;a more excellent way.&quot;
We seek the welfare of all, the rich and the poor, the bond and
the free. While we repudiate all acknowledgment of property
in human beings, we rejoice in the honest, lawful prosperity of
the planter. Let not, we beseech you, the freedom of the slave
proceed from the armed invader of your soil, nor from his own
torch and dagger&mdash;but from <i>your</i> peaceful and constitutional
interference in his behalf.</p>

<p class="indent">In breaking the chains which bind the slave, be assured you
will be delivering yourselves from a grievous thraldom. Ponder
well, we implore you, the following suggestions.</p>

<p class="indent">Without your co-operation, the slaveholders, much as they
despise you, are powerless. To you they look for agents, and
stewards, for overseers, and drivers, and patrols. To you they
look for votes to elevate them to office, and to you they too often
look for aid to enforce their Lynch laws. Feel then your own
power; claim your rights, and exert them for the deliverance of
the slave, and consequently for your own happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p class="indent">Let then your first demand be for <span class="smcap">liberty of speech</span>. Your
Constitution and laws guarantee to you this right in the most
solemn and explicit terms; and yet you have permitted a few
slaveholders to rob you of it. Resume it at once. Be not afraid
to speak openly of your wrongs, and of the true cause of them.
Dread not the Lynch clubs. Their power depends wholly on
opinion. The slaveholders are not strong enough to execute their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
own sentences, if <i>you</i> resist them. They shrank, in Charleston,
from prohibiting the sale of Dickens&#39; Notes, because they believed
the people were determined to read them. Had the same curiosity
been felt in Petersburg, to read the article on Bible Slavery
in Breckenridge&#39;s Magazine, the slaveholders there would not
have dared to purloin them from the post-office and burn them
in the street. In the one place they strained at a gnat, in the
other they swallowed a camel. Be assured, your bullies are
timid bullies; not that they are wanting in individual courage,
but because they are aware that their authority rests, not
on their physical strength, but on <i>your</i> habits of deference and
obedience. Speak then boldly, and without disguise; and
be assured that no sooner will your tongues be loosed on the forbidden
subject, than you will be surprised to find what a coincidence
of thought exists in relation to it. Discussion once commenced,
the enemies of slavery will multiply faster with you
than they do elsewhere for the obvious reason, that with you
there is no dispute about <i>facts</i>. You all know and daily witness
the blighting influence of the curse which overspreads your land;
and believe us, that just in proportion as your courage rises, will
the arrogance of your oppressors sink.</p>

<p class="indent">By conversing freely among yourselves, and proclaiming your
hostility to slavery in public meetings, you will create an influence
that will soon reach the <span class="smcap">Press</span>. The bands with which the slaveholders
have bound this Leviathan will then be snapped asunder.
Once establish a <span class="smcap">free press</span>, and the fate of slavery is sealed.
Such a press will advocate your rights, will encourage education
and industry, will point out the true cause of the depravation of
morals, the prevalence of violence, and the depression of the
public welfare.</p>

<p class="indent">Having gained the liberty of speech and of the press, you
will go on, conquering and to conquer. Political action on your
part will lead to new triumphs. The State legislatures and the
public offices will no longer be the exclusive patrimony of the
holders of slaves. Having once obtained a footing in your legislative
halls, you will have secured in a quiet, peaceable, constitutional
mode, the downfall of slavery, the recovery of your rights,
and the prosperity and happiness of your country.</p>

<p class="indent">Think us not extravagantly sanguine. The very horror manifested
by the slaveholders of the means we recommend, is evidence
of their efficacy. We advise you to exercise freedom of speech.
Have they not endeavored to bully you into silence by the threat,
that &quot;the question of slavery is not and shall not be open to
discussion;&quot; and that the moment any private individual talks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
about the means of terminating slavery, &quot;<i>that moment his tongue
shall be cut out and cast upon a dunghill</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Promote a free press. Is not the wisdom of the recommendation
verified by the proclamation made of &quot;<i>instant death</i>&quot; to the
abolition editors in the slave States, if &quot;<i>they avow their opinions</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Your Constitutions have indeed been rendered by the slaveholders
&quot;blurred and obliterated parchments;&quot; be it your care
to restore them to their pristine beauty, and to make them fair
and legible charters of the rights of man.</p>

<p class="indent">But we doubt not, fellow-citizens, that although you give your
cordial assent to all we have said respecting the practical influence
of slavery, you have, nevertheless, some misgivings about
the effect of <i>immediate</i> emancipation. Shut up as you are in
darkness on this subject, threatened with death if you talk or
write about it; while the utmost pains are taken to prevent books
or papers, which might enlighten you, from falling into your
hands, it would be wonderful indeed, were you at once prepared
to admit the safety and policy of instant and unconditional emancipation.
You are assured, and probably believe, that massacre,
and conflagration, and universal ruin would ensue on &quot;letting
loose the negroes;&quot; but you are kept in ignorance of the fact,
that in various parts of the world, negroes have been let loose,
and in no one instance have such consequences followed; and you
are not permitted to learn, in discussion, the <i>reasons</i> why such
consequences never have followed, and never will follow the immediate
abolition of slavery. What think you would be the fate
of the man who should attempt to deliver a lecture in Charleston
or Mobile on the safety of emancipation? Yet such a lecture
might be delivered with perfect safety, were the lecturer to be
accompanied by one or two hundred of <i>your</i> number, declaring
their determination to maintain freedom of speech and to protect
the lecturer. From such a lecture you would learn, with astonishment,
that the atrocities in St. Domingo, so constantly used by
the slaveholders to intimidate the refractory, arose from a civil
war, which the planters, by their own folly and wickedness, kindled
between themselves and the <i>free</i> blacks, and were wholly
independent of the subsequent act of the French Government
manumitting the slaves. You would also hear, perhaps for the
first time, of the peaceful abolition of slavery in Mexico and South
America. You would listen, with a surprise almost bordering on
incredulity, to accounts of the glorious, wonderful success, attending
the emancipation of 800,000 slaves in the British Colonies,
without the loss of a single life. You would learn that in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
colonies, among the liberated slaves, ten, twenty, thirty times as
numerous as the whites, a degree of tranquility and good order
and security is enjoyed, utterly unknown in any Southern or
Western slave State. The complaints (grossly exaggerated, if
they reach you through the medium of a pro-slavery press) of
the want of labor and the diminution of production, arise not
from the idleness, but the <i>industry</i> of the enfranchised slaves.
Their wives and children, no longer toiling under the lash, are
now engaged in the occupations of the family and of the school;
while many of the fathers and husbands have become landholders,
and raise their own food, and also articles for the market. Substantial
and honest prosperity is gradually taking the place of
that wealth, which, as in all other slave countries, was concentrated
in the hands of a few, and was extorted from the labor of
a wretched, degraded and dangerous population.</p>

<p class="indent">If you admit the greatest happiness of the greatest number to
be the true test of national prosperity, then, beyond all controversy,
the British West Indies are now infinitely more prosperous
than at any previous period of their history.</p>

<p class="indent">Despots and aristocrats have, in all ages, been afraid of &quot;turning
loose&quot; the <span class="smcap">people</span>, no matter of what hue was their complexion.
You have seen that your own McDuffie does not scruple to intimate,
that, were not the Southern laborers already shackled, an
order of nobility would be required to keep them in subjection;
and a shudder seizes Chancellor Harper, when he reflects that
the Northern allies of the slaveholders are democrats and
agrarians.</p>

<p class="indent">A glorious career opens before you. In the place of your present
contempt, and degradation, and misery, honor, and wealth,
and happiness court your acceptance. By abolishing slavery
you will become the architects of your own fortune, and of your
country&#39;s greatness. The times are propitious for the great
achievement. You will be cheered by the approbation of your
own consciences, and by the plaudits of mankind. The institution
which oppresses you is suffering from the decrepitude of
age, and is the scorn and loathing of the world. Out of the
slave region, patriots and philanthropists, and Christians of every
name and sect abhor and execrate it. Do you pant for liberty
and equality, more substantial than such as is now found only in
your obliterated and tattered bills of right? Do you ask that your
children may be rescued from the ignorance and irreligion to
which they are now doomed, and that avenues may be opened
for you and for them to honest and profitable employment? Unite
then, we beseech you, with one heart and one mind, for the legal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
constitutional abolition of slavery. The enemy is waxing faint
and losing his courage. He is terrified by the echo of his own
threats, and the very proposal to dissolve the Union and leave
him to his fate, throws him into paroxysms. The North, so long
submissive to his mandates, and awed by his insolence, laughs at
his impotent rage; and all his hopes now rest upon a few profligate
politicians whom he purchases with his votes, while their
baseness excites his contempt, and their principles his fears. Now
is the time, fellow-citizens, to assail the foe. Up&mdash;quit yourselves
like men: and may Almighty God direct and bless your efforts!</p>
